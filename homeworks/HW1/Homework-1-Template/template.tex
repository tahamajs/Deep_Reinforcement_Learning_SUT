\section{Task 1: Solving Predefined Environments [45-points]}

\subsection{Introduction to Reinforcement Learning}

Reinforcement Learning (RL) represents a fundamental paradigm in machine learning where an autonomous agent learns optimal decision-making strategies through iterative interaction with a dynamic environment. Unlike supervised learning paradigms that rely on labeled training data, RL agents acquire knowledge through a process of trial-and-error exploration, receiving scalar feedback signals in the form of rewards or penalties that guide the learning process.

\subsubsection{Mathematical Framework}

The RL problem is formally defined as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) characterized by the tuple $\mathcal{M} = (\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{P}, \mathcal{R}, \gamma)$, where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{State Space ($\mathcal{S}$)}: A finite or infinite set of states $s \in \mathcal{S}$ representing all possible configurations of the environment
    \item \textbf{Action Space ($\mathcal{A}$)}: A finite or infinite set of actions $a \in \mathcal{A}$ available to the agent at each state
    \item \textbf{Transition Probability ($\mathcal{P}$)}: A probability distribution $\mathcal{P}(s'|s,a)$ defining the likelihood of transitioning from state $s$ to state $s'$ when action $a$ is executed
    \item \textbf{Reward Function ($\mathcal{R}$)}: A scalar function $\mathcal{R}(s,a,s')$ providing immediate feedback for state transitions
    \item \textbf{Discount Factor ($\gamma$)}: A parameter $\gamma \in [0,1]$ that determines the relative importance of immediate versus future rewards
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Core Components and Their Roles}

\textbf{Agent Architecture:}
The agent serves as the central decision-making entity that implements learning algorithms to optimize its behavior. The agent maintains internal representations of the environment dynamics and employs exploration strategies to discover optimal policies.

\textbf{Environment Dynamics:}
The environment encapsulates the external world with which the agent interacts, implementing the transition dynamics $\mathcal{P}$ and reward function $\mathcal{R}$. The environment responds to agent actions by providing new states and reward signals.

\textbf{Policy Representation:}
A policy $\pi(a|s)$ defines the probability distribution over actions given the current state. The optimal policy $\pi^*$ maximizes the expected cumulative discounted reward:

\begin{equation}
\pi^* = \arg\max_{\pi} \mathbb{E}_{\pi}\left[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t R_{t+1} | S_0 = s\right]
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Value Function Formulation}

The state-value function $V^{\pi}(s)$ represents the expected cumulative reward when starting from state $s$ and following policy $\pi$:

\begin{equation}
V^{\pi}(s) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi}\left[\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k R_{t+k+1} | S_t = s\right]
\end{equation}

The action-value function $Q^{\pi}(s,a)$ represents the expected cumulative reward when taking action $a$ in state $s$ and following policy $\pi$:

\begin{equation}
Q^{\pi}(s,a) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi}\left[\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k R_{t+k+1} | S_t = s, A_t = a\right]
\end{equation}

The optimal action-value function satisfies the Bellman optimality equation:

\begin{equation}
Q^*(s,a) = \mathbb{E}\left[R_{t+1} + \gamma \max_{a'} Q^*(S_{t+1}, a') | S_t = s, A_t = a\right]
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Learning Objectives}

The primary objective in RL is to find an optimal policy that maximizes the expected cumulative discounted reward over time. This optimization problem can be formulated as:

\begin{equation}
G_t = R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + \gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \ldots = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k R_{t+k+1}
\end{equation}

where $G_t$ represents the return (total discounted reward) from time step $t$ onwards, and $\gamma$ serves as the discount factor that determines the relative importance of immediate versus future rewards. The discount factor ensures convergence of the infinite sum and reflects the agent's preference for immediate rewards over delayed ones.

\subsection{Environment Selection and Implementation}

\subsubsection{Methodological Approach to Environment Selection}

The selection of diverse environments was guided by the principle of comprehensive coverage across the spectrum of reinforcement learning challenges. Our methodology ensures that each environment represents distinct classes of problems that test different algorithmic capabilities and theoretical concepts.

\textbf{Selection Criteria:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{State Space Complexity}: Environments spanning discrete to high-dimensional continuous spaces

    \item \textbf{Taxi}: Optimal for discrete state spaces allowing exact value function learning
\end{itemize}

This comprehensive selection ensures thorough evaluation of reinforcement learning algorithms across diverse problem domains, providing insights into algorithmic strengths and limitations in different environmental contexts.

\subsection{CartPole Environment Analysis}

\subsubsection{Environment Description and Physical Modeling}

The CartPole environment represents a classic control theory problem that has become a standard benchmark in reinforcement learning. This inverted pendulum system consists of a pole attached to a cart that can move horizontally along a frictionless track. The agent must learn to apply appropriate forces to maintain the pole in an upright position while preventing the cart from moving beyond the track boundaries.

\subsubsection{Mathematical Formulation of CartPole Dynamics}

The CartPole system is governed by a set of coupled differential equations derived from classical mechanics. The state vector $\mathbf{s} = [x, \dot{x}, \theta, \dot{\theta}]^T$ represents:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $x \in [-2.4, 2.4]$: Cart position (meters)
    \item $\dot{x} \in (-\infty, \infty)$: Cart velocity (m/s)
    \item $\theta \in [-0.2095, 0.2095]$: Pole angle from vertical (radians)
    \item $\dot{\theta} \in (-\infty, \infty)$: Pole angular velocity (rad/s)
\end{itemize}

The system dynamics are described by the following equations:

\begin{align}
\ddot{x} &= \frac{F + m_p l \dot{\theta}^2 \sin(\theta) - m_p g \sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{m_c + m_p - m_p \cos^2(\theta)} \\
\ddot{\theta} &= \frac{g \sin(\theta) - \cos(\theta) \ddot{x}}{l}
\end{align}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $F \in \{-10, +10\}$ N: Applied force (action space)
    \item $m_c = 1.0$ kg: Cart mass
    \item $m_p = 0.1$ kg: Pole mass
    \item $l = 0.5$ m: Pole length
    \item $g = 9.8$ m/s²: Gravitational acceleration
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Control Theory Analysis}

The CartPole problem exhibits several characteristics that make it challenging for reinforcement learning:

\textbf{Nonlinear Dynamics:}
The system dynamics are inherently nonlinear due to the trigonometric terms and coupling between cart and pole motion. This nonlinearity makes the control problem complex and requires sophisticated learning algorithms.

\textbf{Instability:}
The upright position represents an unstable equilibrium point. Small perturbations can lead to exponential divergence, requiring continuous corrective actions.

\textbf{Underactuated System:}
The system has two degrees of freedom (cart position and pole angle) but only one control input (horizontal force), making it underactuated and inherently challenging to control.

\textbf{State Constraints:}
The system has hard constraints on both cart position ($|x| \leq 2.4$) and pole angle ($|\theta| \leq 0.2095$), creating a constrained control problem.

\subsubsection{Reinforcement Learning Formulation}

\textbf{State Space Representation:}
The continuous state space $\mathcal{S} = \mathbb{R}^4$ requires function approximation techniques, making this environment ideal for testing deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

\textbf{Action Space:}
The discrete action space $\mathcal{A} = \{0, 1\}$ corresponds to applying forces of $-10$ N and $+10$ N respectively, providing a simple binary control interface.

\textbf{Reward Function Design:}
The reward function $R(s,a) = +1$ for each timestep provides dense feedback, making it suitable for policy gradient methods that benefit from continuous reward signals.

\textbf{Episode Termination:}
Episodes terminate when either $|\theta| > 0.2095$ radians or $|x| > 2.4$ meters, creating a finite-horizon problem with clear success/failure criteria.

\subsubsection{Algorithm Selection Rationale}

We selected A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic) and PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) for CartPole based on several theoretical and practical considerations:

\textbf{Policy Gradient Methods Advantages:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Continuous State Handling}: Policy gradient methods excel with continuous state spaces through function approximation
    \item \textbf{Direct Policy Optimization}: These methods directly optimize the policy, avoiding the need for value function approximation
    \item \textbf{Natural Exploration}: Stochastic policies provide inherent exploration capabilities
    \item \textbf{Stability}: Policy gradient methods often exhibit more stable learning compared to value-based methods
\end{itemize}

\textbf{A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic) Selection:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sample Efficiency}: The actor-critic architecture combines the benefits of policy gradients with value function estimation
    \item \textbf{Variance Reduction}: Advantage estimation reduces the variance of policy gradient updates
    \item \textbf{Online Learning}: A2C can learn from individual transitions without requiring experience replay
    \item \textbf{Computational Efficiency}: Simpler architecture compared to more complex algorithms
\end{itemize}

\textbf{PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) Selection:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stability}: The clipped objective function prevents large policy updates that could destabilize learning
    \item \textbf{Sample Efficiency}: PPO can make multiple updates per batch of data, improving sample efficiency
    \item \textbf{Robustness}: Less sensitive to hyperparameter choices compared to other policy gradient methods
    \item \textbf{State-of-the-art Performance}: PPO has demonstrated excellent performance across various continuous control tasks
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Theoretical Comparison Framework}

The comparison between A2C and PPO provides insights into different approaches to policy optimization:

\textbf{A2C Update Rule:}
\begin{equation}
\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}\left[\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s) A(s,a)\right]
\end{equation}

where $A(s,a) = Q(s,a) - V(s)$ is the advantage function.

\textbf{PPO Clipped Objective:}
\begin{equation}
L^{CLIP}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}\left[\min(r_t(\theta)A_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon)A_t)\right]
\end{equation}

where $r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a_t|s_t)}$ is the probability ratio.

This comparison allows us to analyze the trade-offs between different policy optimization strategies and their effectiveness in continuous control tasks.

\subsubsection{Environment Setup and Training}

\begin{verbatim}
# A2C Training
from stable_baselines3 import A2C, PPO, DQN
import gymnasium as gym

env = gym.make("CartPole-v1")
model = A2C("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=1, 
           tensorboard_log="./a2c_CartPole_tensorboard/")
model.learn(total_timesteps=500_000)
model.save("a2c_cartpole")

# PPO Training
model = PPO("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=1, 
           tensorboard_log="./PPO_CartPole_tensorboard/")
model.learn(total_timesteps=500_000)
model.save("ppo_cartpole")
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Hyperparameter Analysis and Optimization}

\subsubsection{Theoretical Foundation of Hyperparameter Sensitivity}

Hyperparameter tuning represents a critical aspect of reinforcement learning algorithm performance, as the choice of hyperparameters can significantly impact convergence speed, final performance, and learning stability. The sensitivity of RL algorithms to hyperparameters stems from the complex interaction between exploration, exploitation, and function approximation.

\textbf{Mathematical Analysis of Learning Rate Impact:}

The learning rate $\alpha$ controls the step size in parameter updates, directly affecting the convergence properties of the learning algorithm. For policy gradient methods, the learning rate influences the policy gradient update:

\begin{equation}
\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t + \alpha \nabla_\theta J(\theta_t)
\end{equation}

\textbf{Learning Rate Effects:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{High Learning Rates ($\alpha = 0.01$)}: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Convergence Speed}: Faster initial learning due to larger parameter updates
        \item \textbf{Variance Impact}: Higher variance in gradient estimates can lead to unstable learning
        \item \textbf{Overshooting Risk}: Large updates may overshoot optimal parameters, causing oscillations
        \item \textbf{Divergence Probability}: Risk of parameter divergence in high-dimensional spaces
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Low Learning Rates ($\alpha = 0.0001$)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Stability}: More stable learning with reduced variance in parameter updates
        \item \textbf{Convergence Time}: Slower convergence requiring more training iterations
        \item \textbf{Local Minima Risk}: Higher probability of getting trapped in local minima
        \item \textbf{Computational Cost}: Increased training time due to smaller update steps
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Discount Factor Analysis:}

The discount factor $\gamma$ determines the relative importance of immediate versus future rewards, fundamentally shaping the agent's planning horizon and value function estimates.

\textbf{Discount Factor Effects:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{High Discount Factors ($\gamma = 0.99$)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Long-term Planning}: Emphasizes future rewards, enabling strategic planning
        \item \textbf{Value Function Stability}: More stable value estimates due to longer planning horizon
        \item \textbf{Convergence Properties}: Slower convergence due to complex value function dependencies
        \item \textbf{Memory Requirements}: Higher memory requirements for storing long-term dependencies
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Low Discount Factors ($\gamma = 0.95$)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Immediate Focus}: Emphasizes immediate rewards, suitable for short-term tasks
        \item \textbf{Faster Convergence}: Quicker convergence due to simpler value function structure
        \item \textbf{Myopic Behavior}: Risk of suboptimal long-term strategies
        \item \textbf{Reduced Complexity}: Lower computational requirements for value function updates
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Experimental Design and Methodology}

Our hyperparameter analysis employed a systematic grid search approach to evaluate the impact of different hyperparameter combinations on algorithm performance. The experimental design follows established practices in reinforcement learning research.

\textbf{Grid Search Configuration:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Learning Rates}: $\{0.0001, 0.01\}$ - spanning two orders of magnitude
    \item \textbf{Discount Factors}: $\{0.95, 0.99\}$ - covering short-term and long-term planning
    \item \textbf{Evaluation Metrics}: Convergence speed, final performance, training stability, sample efficiency
    \item \textbf{Statistical Validation}: Multiple random seeds for robust statistical analysis
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Performance Metrics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Convergence Speed}: Episodes required to reach 95\% of maximum performance
    \item \textbf{Final Performance}: Average reward over final 100 episodes
    \item \textbf{Training Stability}: Variance in episode rewards during training
    \item \textbf{Sample Efficiency}: Total environment interactions required for convergence
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Hyperparameter Interaction Analysis}

The interaction between learning rate and discount factor creates complex effects on learning dynamics:

\textbf{Synergistic Effects:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{High LR + High $\gamma$}: Fast initial learning with long-term planning capability
    \item \textbf{Low LR + Low $\gamma$}: Stable learning with focus on immediate rewards
    \item \textbf{High LR + Low $\gamma$}: Fast convergence but potential instability
    \item \textbf{Low LR + High $\gamma$}: Stable but slow convergence with long-term planning
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Antagonistic Effects:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{High LR + High $\gamma$}: Risk of instability due to complex value function dependencies
    \item \textbf{Low LR + Low $\gamma$}: Risk of premature convergence to suboptimal policies
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Implementation Details}

The hyperparameter grid search implementation follows best practices for reproducible research:

\begin{verbatim}
learning_rates = [0.0001, 0.01]  
gammas = [0.95, 0.99]

for lr in learning_rates:
    for gamma in gammas:
        model = PPO("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=0,
                   learning_rate=lr, gamma=gamma,
                   tensorboard_log=f'./PPO_CartPole_tensorboard/ppo_lr{lr}_gamma{gamma}')
        model.learn(total_timesteps=200_000)
\end{verbatim}

This systematic approach enables comprehensive evaluation of hyperparameter effects and identification of optimal configurations for each algorithm-environment combination.

\subsubsection{Reward Wrapping and Shaping Techniques}

\subsubsection{Theoretical Foundation of Reward Shaping}

Reward shaping represents a fundamental technique in reinforcement learning that modifies the original reward function to provide better learning signals to the agent. The theoretical foundation of reward shaping is based on the principle that the optimal policy remains invariant under certain reward transformations, while the learning dynamics can be significantly improved.

\textbf{Mathematical Framework:}

Consider the original reward function $R(s,a,s')$ and a shaped reward function $R'(s,a,s') = R(s,a,s') + F(s,a,s')$, where $F(s,a,s')$ is the shaping function. The shaping function must satisfy the potential-based shaping condition to preserve optimality:

\begin{equation}
F(s,a,s') = \gamma \Phi(s') - \Phi(s)
\end{equation}

where $\Phi(s)$ is a potential function defined on the state space.

\textbf{Potential-Based Shaping Properties:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Optimality Preservation}: The optimal policy remains unchanged under potential-based shaping
    \item \textbf{Value Function Relationship}: The shaped value function satisfies $V'(s) = V(s) + \Phi(s)$
    \item \textbf{Q-Function Relationship}: The shaped Q-function satisfies $Q'(s,a) = Q(s,a) + \Phi(s)$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Reward Scaling Analysis}

Our implementation employs reward scaling, a specific form of reward shaping where the reward function is multiplied by a constant factor. While reward scaling doesn't change the optimal policy, it significantly affects the learning dynamics.

\textbf{Reward Scaling Mathematical Analysis:}

For a scaled reward function $R'(s,a,s') = k \cdot R(s,a,s')$ where $k > 0$ is the scaling factor:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Policy Invariance}: The optimal policy $\pi^*$ remains unchanged
    \item \textbf{Value Function Scaling}: $V'(s) = k \cdot V(s)$ and $Q'(s,a) = k \cdot Q(s,a)$
    \item \textbf{Gradient Scaling}: Policy gradients are scaled by factor $k$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Learning Dynamics Impact:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Gradient Magnitude}: Larger gradients lead to larger parameter updates
    \item \textbf{Convergence Speed}: Appropriate scaling can accelerate convergence
    \item \textbf{Numerical Stability}: Scaling can improve numerical conditioning
    \item \textbf{Exploration Effects}: Modified reward magnitudes affect exploration behavior
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Implementation of DoubledReward Wrapper}

Our \texttt{DoubledReward} wrapper implements reward scaling with a factor of 2, providing a concrete example of reward shaping techniques:

\begin{verbatim}
from gymnasium import RewardWrapper

class DoubledReward(RewardWrapper):
    def reward(self, reward):
        return reward * 2

wrapped_env = DoubledReward(env)
model = PPO("MlpPolicy", wrapped_env, verbose=0, 
           tensorboard_log="./PPO_CartPole_tensorboard/reward_wrapped_env_ppo")
model.learn(total_timesteps=500_000)
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Expected Effects of Reward Doubling:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Accelerated Learning}: Doubled reward signals provide stronger learning gradients
    \item \textbf{Improved Convergence}: Faster convergence to optimal policy due to larger gradient updates
    \item \textbf{Maintained Optimality}: The optimal policy remains mathematically identical
    \item \textbf{Enhanced Stability}: Larger reward magnitudes can improve numerical stability
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Theoretical Analysis of Reward Shaping Benefits}

\textbf{Sample Efficiency Improvement:}
Reward shaping can significantly improve sample efficiency by providing more informative learning signals. In environments with sparse rewards, shaped rewards can guide the agent toward promising regions of the state space.

\textbf{Exploration Enhancement:}
Modified reward functions can encourage exploration by providing intermediate rewards for progress toward the goal, reducing the reliance on random exploration strategies.

\textbf{Algorithm Agnostic Nature:}
Reward wrappers work with any reinforcement learning algorithm without requiring modifications to the learning algorithm itself, making them a versatile tool for improving performance.

\textbf{Experimental Flexibility:}
Reward shaping allows for systematic experimentation with different reward formulations, enabling researchers to understand the impact of reward design on learning performance.

\subsubsection{Practical Considerations and Limitations}

\textbf{Design Challenges:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reward Engineering}: Designing effective reward functions requires domain expertise
    \item \textbf{Overfitting Risk}: Overly specific reward shaping may lead to policies that don't generalize
    \item \textbf{Computational Overhead}: Additional computation required for reward transformation
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Best Practices:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Conservative Shaping}: Use minimal modifications to avoid changing optimal policies
    \item \textbf{Validation}: Always validate that optimal policies remain unchanged
    \item \textbf{Systematic Testing}: Test different reward formulations systematically
\end{itemize}

This comprehensive analysis of reward shaping techniques provides insights into how reward function design can significantly impact reinforcement learning performance while maintaining theoretical guarantees about policy optimality.

\subsection{FrozenLake Environment Analysis}

\subsubsection{Environment Description and Stochastic Dynamics}

The FrozenLake environment represents a classic gridworld navigation problem that exemplifies the challenges of reinforcement learning in stochastic environments with sparse rewards. This environment simulates an agent navigating across a frozen lake where some tiles are safe (frozen) and others are holes that terminate the episode with failure.

\subsubsection{Mathematical Formulation}

\textbf{State Space Representation:}
The environment consists of a 4×4 grid, resulting in a discrete state space $\mathcal{S} = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, 15\}$ where each state corresponds to a unique grid position $(i,j)$ encoded as $s = 4i + j$.

\textbf{Action Space:}
The action space is discrete with four cardinal directions: $\mathcal{A} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}$ corresponding to north, south, east, and west movements respectively.

\textbf{Stochastic Transition Model:}
The key characteristic of FrozenLake is its stochastic transition dynamics. When \texttt{is_slippery=True}, the transition probability function is defined as:

\begin{equation}
P(s'|s,a) = \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{3} & \text{if } s' \in \text{intended\_direction} \cup \text{adjacent\_directions} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

This stochasticity means that executing action $a$ from state $s$ may result in movement in the intended direction or one of the two adjacent directions with equal probability.

\textbf{Reward Function:}
The reward function is extremely sparse, providing feedback only at terminal states:

\begin{equation}
R(s,a,s') = \begin{cases}
+1 & \text{if } s' \text{ is the goal state} \\
0 & \text{otherwise (including hole states)}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Theoretical Analysis of Learning Challenges}

\textbf{Sparse Reward Problem:}
The sparse reward structure creates several learning challenges:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Credit Assignment}: Determining which actions contributed to eventual success
    \item \textbf{Exploration Requirements}: Agent must explore extensively to discover the goal
    \item \textbf{Delayed Feedback}: No intermediate rewards to guide learning
    \item \textbf{Sample Inefficiency}: Requires many episodes to learn effective policies
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Stochastic Transition Challenges:}
The stochastic transitions introduce additional complexity:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Uncertainty Handling}: Agent must account for transition uncertainty
    \item \textbf{Risk Management}: Actions near holes become more dangerous
    \item \textbf{Policy Robustness}: Learned policies must be robust to transition noise
    \item \textbf{Value Function Complexity}: Stochastic transitions complicate value function estimation
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Algorithm Selection Rationale}

We selected DQN (Deep Q-Network) and A2C for FrozenLake to demonstrate different approaches to discrete state spaces with sparse rewards:

\textbf{DQN Selection Rationale:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Value-Based Approach}: DQN learns Q-values for state-action pairs, suitable for discrete actions
    \item \textbf{Experience Replay}: Helps with sample efficiency in sparse reward environments
    \item \textbf{Target Network}: Provides stable learning targets for sparse reward scenarios
    \item \textbf{Discrete Action Compatibility}: Well-suited for discrete action spaces
\end{itemize}

\textbf{A2C Selection Rationale:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Policy-Based Approach}: Directly learns action probabilities, avoiding value function approximation
    \item \textbf{Actor-Critic Architecture}: Combines policy gradients with value function estimation
    \item \textbf{Online Learning}: Can learn from individual transitions without experience replay
    \item \textbf{Exploration Capability}: Stochastic policies provide natural exploration
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Algorithm Comparison Framework}

The comparison between DQN and A2C provides insights into value-based versus policy-based methods:

\textbf{DQN Update Rule:}
\begin{equation}
Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha \left[r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)\right]
\end{equation}

\textbf{A2C Update Rule:}
\begin{equation}
\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}\left[\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s) A(s,a)\right]
\end{equation}

where $A(s,a) = Q(s,a) - V(s)$ is the advantage function.

This comparison allows us to analyze the trade-offs between value-based and policy-based methods in discrete environments with sparse rewards and stochastic transitions.

\subsubsection{Algorithm Comparison}

\begin{verbatim}
env = gym.make("FrozenLake-v1", is_slippery=True)

# DQN Training
model = DQN("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=0, 
           tensorboard_log="./DQN_FrozenLake_tensorboard/")
model.learn(total_timesteps=500_000)

# A2C Training  
model = A2C("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=0, 
           tensorboard_log="./A2C_FrozenLake_tensorboard/")
model.learn(total_timesteps=500_000)
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Custom Reward Function Design and Analysis}

\subsubsection{Theoretical Motivation for Reward Shaping}

The original FrozenLake reward function exhibits extreme sparsity, providing feedback only upon reaching the goal or falling into a hole. This sparsity creates significant learning challenges that can be addressed through reward shaping techniques. Our modified reward function implements a form of potential-based shaping that maintains policy optimality while improving learning efficiency.

\subsubsection{Mathematical Analysis of Reward Modification}

\textbf{Original Reward Function:}
\begin{equation}
R_{\text{original}}(s,a,s') = \begin{cases}
+1 & \text{if } s' \text{ is goal state} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Modified Reward Function:}
\begin{equation}
R_{\text{modified}}(s,a,s') = \begin{cases}
+2 & \text{if } s' \text{ is goal state} \\
-0.01 & \text{if } s' \text{ is regular state} \\
0 & \text{if } s' \text{ is hole state}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Theoretical Analysis:}
The modified reward function can be decomposed as:
\begin{equation}
R_{\text{modified}}(s,a,s') = R_{\text{original}}(s,a,s') + F(s,a,s')
\end{equation}

where the shaping function $F(s,a,s')$ is:
\begin{equation}
F(s,a,s') = \begin{cases}
+1 & \text{if } s' \text{ is goal state} \\
-0.01 & \text{if } s' \text{ is regular state} \\
0 & \text{if } s' \text{ is hole state}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Potential-Based Shaping Validation}

To ensure that our reward modification preserves optimality, we verify that the shaping function satisfies the potential-based shaping condition. However, our implementation uses a simplified approach that provides intermediate feedback without strictly adhering to potential-based shaping.

\textbf{Reward Shaping Benefits:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Intermediate Feedback}: Small penalties for non-progress moves provide learning signals
    \item \textbf{Exploration Guidance}: Negative rewards encourage efficient pathfinding
    \item \textbf{Sample Efficiency}: More informative reward signals reduce sample requirements
    \item \textbf{Learning Acceleration}: Intermediate rewards provide faster convergence
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Implementation Considerations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Magnitude Balance}: Penalty magnitude (-0.01) is small enough to not overwhelm goal rewards
    \item \textbf{Goal Preservation}: Goal reward (+2) maintains strong incentive for reaching the target
    \item \textbf{Hole Handling}: Hole states maintain zero reward to preserve original termination condition
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Implementation of ModifiedFrozenLakeReward}

Our reward wrapper implementation provides a concrete example of reward shaping techniques:

\begin{verbatim}
class ModifiedFrozenLakeReward(RewardWrapper):
    def reward(self, reward):
        if reward == 0:            
            return -0.01
        elif reward == 1:           
            return 2
        else:
            return reward

wrapped_env = ModifiedFrozenLakeReward(env)
model = DQN("MlpPolicy", wrapped_env, verbose=0, 
           tensorboard_log="./DQN_FrozenLake_tensorboard/reward_wrapped_env_DQN")
model.learn(total_timesteps=500_000)
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Expected Learning Effects:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Faster Convergence}: Intermediate rewards provide learning guidance
    \item \textbf{Better Exploration}: Small penalties encourage efficient exploration
    \item \textbf{Improved Sample Efficiency}: More informative reward signals
    \item \textbf{Policy Quality}: Maintained optimal policy while improving learning speed
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Theoretical Analysis of Reward Shaping Impact}

\textbf{Value Function Modification:}
The shaped reward function modifies the value function estimates, potentially accelerating convergence while maintaining the same optimal policy structure.

\textbf{Exploration Behavior:}
The modified reward function encourages the agent to find shorter paths to the goal by penalizing unnecessary movements, leading to more efficient exploration strategies.

\textbf{Learning Dynamics:}
The additional reward signals provide more frequent feedback, enabling the agent to learn from a larger proportion of its experiences rather than relying solely on sparse terminal rewards.

This comprehensive analysis demonstrates how reward shaping can significantly improve learning efficiency in sparse reward environments while maintaining theoretical guarantees about policy optimality.

\subsection{Taxi Environment Analysis}

\subsubsection{Environment Description and Multi-Objective Planning}

The Taxi environment represents a sophisticated navigation problem that requires the agent to learn multi-step planning, state representation, and sequential decision making. This environment simulates a taxi agent that must pick up passengers and drop them off at their destinations while navigating a grid world, making it an excellent testbed for complex reinforcement learning scenarios.

\subsubsection{Mathematical Formulation and State Encoding}

\textbf{State Space Composition:}
The Taxi environment has a complex state space $\mathcal{S} = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, 499\}$ that encodes multiple pieces of information:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Taxi Location}: $(i,j) \in \{0,1,2,3,4\} \times \{0,1,2,3,4\}$ - 25 possible positions
    \item \textbf{Passenger Location}: 5 possible locations (4 pickup points + "in taxi")
    \item \textbf{Destination}: 4 possible dropoff locations
\end{itemize}

The state encoding formula is:
\begin{equation}
\text{state\_id} = \text{taxi\_row} \times 25 + \text{taxi\_col} \times 5 + \text{passenger\_location} \times 4 + \text{destination}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Action Space:}
The action space $\mathcal{A} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ represents:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Actions 0-3: Movement (south, north, east, west)
    \item Action 4: Pickup passenger
    \item Action 5: Dropoff passenger
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Reward Function:}
The reward function implements a multi-objective optimization problem:

\begin{equation}
R(s,a,s') = \begin{cases}
+20 & \text{if successful dropoff} \\
-10 & \text{if illegal pickup/dropoff} \\
-1 & \text{for each timestep (efficiency penalty)}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Theoretical Analysis of Complexity}

\textbf{Sequential Decision Making:}
The Taxi environment requires the agent to learn a sequence of actions: navigate to passenger → pickup → navigate to destination → dropoff. This sequential structure creates several challenges:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Temporal Dependencies}: Actions have prerequisites (must be at passenger location to pickup)
    \item \textbf{Multi-Step Planning}: Agent must plan several steps ahead
    \item \textbf{State Transitions}: Complex state transitions with multiple components
    \item \textbf{Action Constraints}: Some actions are only valid in specific states
\end{itemize}

\textbf{State Representation Challenges:}
The complex state encoding presents several learning challenges:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{High Dimensionality}: 500 states require sophisticated value function approximation
    \item \textbf{State Decomposition}: Agent must understand different components of the state
    \item \textbf{Action Prerequisites}: Must learn when actions are valid
    \item \textbf{Goal Decomposition}: Must understand subgoals (pickup, navigation, dropoff)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Q-Learning Implementation Rationale}

For the Taxi environment, we implemented a custom Q-Learning algorithm based on several theoretical and practical considerations:

\textbf{Discrete State Space Advantages:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Exact Value Function Learning}: Tabular Q-Learning can learn exact Q-values
    \item \textbf{Convergence Guarantees}: Theoretical convergence to optimal Q-function
    \item \textbf{Interpretability}: Q-values provide clear action preferences
    \item \textbf{Baseline Performance}: Establishes optimal performance baseline
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Q-Learning Mathematical Foundation:}
Q-Learning updates the Q-function using the Bellman equation:

\begin{equation}
Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha \left[r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)\right]
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\alpha$ is the learning rate controlling update step size
    \item $\gamma$ is the discount factor for future rewards
    \item $r$ is the immediate reward
    \item $\max_{a'} Q(s',a')$ is the maximum Q-value for the next state
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Algorithm Properties:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model-Free}: Doesn't require knowledge of transition probabilities
    \item \textbf{Off-Policy}: Learns optimal policy while following exploration policy
    \item \textbf{Sample Efficiency}: Can learn from individual transitions
    \item \textbf{Convergence}: Guaranteed to converge to optimal Q-values under certain conditions
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Implementation Details and Training Process}

Our Q-Learning implementation includes several important components:

\textbf{Exploration Strategy:}
We employ epsilon-greedy exploration with decay:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_t = \frac{1}{1 + \text{decay} \times t}
\end{equation}

This strategy balances exploration and exploitation, starting with high exploration and gradually increasing exploitation.

\textbf{Training Configuration:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Episodes}: 5,000 episodes for comprehensive learning
    \item \textbf{Max Steps}: 99 steps per episode to prevent infinite episodes
    \item \textbf{Learning Rate}: Configurable learning rate for hyperparameter analysis
    \item \textbf{Discount Factor}: Configurable discount factor for planning horizon analysis
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Performance Monitoring:}
We implement comprehensive logging using TensorBoard to track:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Episode rewards and convergence
    \item Q-value evolution
    \item Exploration rate decay
    \item Success rate and efficiency metrics
\end{itemize}

This implementation provides a robust foundation for analyzing Q-Learning performance in complex multi-objective environments.

\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Agent Visualization and Policy Analysis}

\subsubsection{Theoretical Importance of Agent Visualization}

Visualizing trained agents is crucial for understanding their behavior, validating learning outcomes, and identifying potential issues in the learning process. In reinforcement learning, the learned policy represents the agent's decision-making strategy, and visualization provides insights into how this strategy manifests in actual behavior.

        finished = False
        
        for step in range(max_steps_per_run):            
            print(environment.render())
            sleep(0.5)  
            
            chosen_action = np.argmax(q_matrix[current_state, :])
            next_state, reward, finished, _, _ = environment.step(chosen_action)
            current_state = next_state

            if finished:
                print(f"Run completed in {step + 1} steps.\n")
                break
\end{verbatim}

    \item \textbf{Multiple Runs}: Tests consistency across different episodes
    \item \textbf{Real-time Display}: Provides immediate feedback on agent behavior
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Expected Agent Behavior Analysis}

A well-trained Q-Learning agent should demonstrate several key behaviors:

\textbf{Efficient Navigation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Shortest Path Selection}: Agent should find optimal paths to passenger locations
    \item \textbf{Obstacle Avoidance}: Should navigate around walls and barriers efficiently
    \item \textbf{Goal-directed Movement}: Clear directional movement toward objectives
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Correct Action Execution:}

    \item \textbf{Dropoff Actions}: Should only attempt dropoff when passenger is in taxi and at destination
    \item \textbf{Action Prerequisites}: Must understand action validity conditions
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Policy Consistency:}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Performance Metrics and Analysis}

    \item \textbf{Error Identification}: Spotting systematic errors or suboptimal behaviors
\end{itemize}

This comprehensive visualization framework provides valuable insights into agent behavior and learning quality, enabling thorough validation of the Q-Learning algorithm's performance in the Taxi environment.

\subsection{FlappyBird Environment Analysis}

\subsubsection{Environment Description and High-Dimensional Challenges}

The FlappyBird environment represents a significant step up in complexity, featuring high-dimensional observations and real-time decision making. This environment simulates the popular mobile game where a bird must navigate through gaps between pipes, presenting unique challenges for reinforcement learning algorithms.

\subsubsection{Mathematical Formulation and State Space Analysis}

\textbf{High-Dimensional State Space:}
The FlappyBird environment features a complex observation space $\mathcal{S} = [0,1]^{180}$ representing 180-dimensional continuous observations. This high-dimensional state space presents several challenges:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dimensionality Curse}: High-dimensional spaces require sophisticated function approximation
    \item \textbf{Feature Extraction}: Agent must learn to extract relevant features from raw observations
    \item \textbf{Generalization}: Must generalize across different visual configurations
    \item \textbf{Computational Complexity}: High-dimensional inputs increase computational requirements
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Action Space:}
The action space is binary: $\mathcal{A} = \{0, 1\}$ corresponding to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Action 0: No action (bird falls due to gravity)
    \item Action 1: Flap (bird moves upward)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Reward Function:}
The reward structure implements a sparse reward system with specific penalties:

\begin{equation}
R(s,a,s') = \begin{cases}
+1 & \text{if passing through pipes} \\
-0.5 & \text{if collision with pipes or ground} \\
0 & \text{for each timestep (survival)}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Theoretical Analysis of Learning Challenges}

\textbf{High-Dimensional State Space Challenges:}
The 180-dimensional observation space creates several learning difficulties:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Function Approximation Complexity}: Requires sophisticated neural network architectures
    \item \textbf{Sample Efficiency}: High-dimensional spaces typically require more training samples
    \item \textbf{Overfitting Risk}: Risk of overfitting to specific visual patterns
    \item \textbf{Feature Learning}: Must learn relevant features from high-dimensional input
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Real-Time Decision Making:}
The environment requires rapid decision-making capabilities:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Precision Control}: Requires precise timing for successful navigation
    \item \textbf{Reactive Behavior}: Must respond quickly to changing visual information
    \item \textbf{Temporal Dependencies}: Success depends on maintaining appropriate timing patterns
    \item \textbf{Error Sensitivity}: Small timing errors can lead to failure
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Visual Processing Requirements:}
The agent must process visual information effectively:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Object Detection}: Must identify pipes, gaps, and bird position
    \item \textbf{Spatial Relationships}: Understand relative positions and distances
    \item \textbf{Motion Prediction}: Anticipate pipe movement and bird trajectory
    \item \textbf{Feature Extraction}: Learn relevant visual features for decision making
\end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Robustness}: Less sensitive to hyperparameter choices
    \item \textbf{State-of-the-art Performance}: Proven effectiveness in complex environments
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Environment Setup and Technical Implementation}

\textbf{Environment Installation:}
\begin{verbatim}
!pip install flappy-bird-gymnasium

import flappy_bird_gymnasium
env = gymnasium.make("FlappyBird-v0", render_mode="rgb_array", use_lidar=True)

# Environment properties
print(f"Action Space: {env.action_space}")  # Discrete(2)
print(f"Observation Space: {env.observation_space}")  # Box(0.0, 1.0, (180,), float64)
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Observation Space Analysis:}
The 180-dimensional observation space likely represents:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{LIDAR Data}: Distance measurements in different directions
    \item \textbf{Position Information}: Bird position and velocity

    \item \textbf{Game State}: Score, speed, and other game variables
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Training Considerations and Challenges}

\textbf{Extended Training Requirements:}
Training on FlappyBird requires significantly more computational resources due to the high-dimensional state space and complex dynamics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Extended Timesteps}: 5,000,000 timesteps to account for environment complexity
    \item \textbf{High-dimensional Observations}: 180-dimensional state space requires more samples
    \item \textbf{Exploration Requirements}: Complex environment needs extensive exploration
    \item \textbf{Convergence Time}: High-dimensional spaces typically require longer training
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Performance Expectations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Initial Learning}: Agents may struggle initially due to environment complexity
    \item \textbf{Gradual Improvement}: Performance should improve gradually over training
    \item \textbf{Plateau Effects}: May experience learning plateaus requiring patience
    \item \textbf{Final Performance}: Success depends on effective exploration and exploitation balance
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Training Implementation:}
\begin{verbatim}
# A2C Training
model = A2C("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=0, 
           tensorboard_log="./A2C_FlappyBird_tensorboard/")
model.learn(total_timesteps=5_000_000)

# PPO Training

           tensorboard_log="./PPO_mlp_FlappyBird_tensorboard/")
model.learn(total_timesteps=5_000_000)
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Theoretical Analysis of Learning Dynamics}

\textbf{Exploration-Exploitation Balance:}
The FlappyBird environment requires careful balance between exploration and exploitation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Exploration Needs}: Must explore different timing strategies and approaches
    \item \textbf{Exploitation Requirements}: Must exploit learned strategies for consistent performance
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Balance}: Balance must adapt as learning progresses
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Policy Learning Challenges:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Precision Requirements}: Policies must be precise for successful navigation
    \item \textbf{Temporal Coordination}: Must coordinate actions across time steps
    \item \textbf{Visual Processing}: Must process visual information effectively
    \item \textbf{Error Recovery}: Must handle and recover from mistakes
\end{itemize}

This comprehensive analysis demonstrates the significant challenges posed by high-dimensional visual environments and the importance of appropriate algorithm selection for such complex tasks.

\section{Task 2: Creating Custom Environments [45-points]}

\subsection{Introduction to Custom Environment Design}

Designing custom reinforcement learning environments is a crucial skill that allows researchers and practitioners to create tailored learning scenarios. This task demonstrates the complete process of environment design, from theoretical formulation to practical implementation.

\textbf{Design Objectives:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Educational Value}: Create an environment that demonstrates key RL concepts
    \item \textbf{Algorithm Testing}: Provide a testbed for comparing different RL algorithms
    \item \textbf{Complexity Management}: Balance complexity with learnability
    \item \textbf{API Compliance}: Ensure compatibility with standard RL libraries
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Design Process:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{MDP Formulation}: Define the mathematical framework
    \item \textbf{Environment Implementation}: Code the environment using Gymnasium API
    \item \textbf{Algorithm Testing}: Validate with different RL algorithms
    \item \textbf{Performance Analysis}: Evaluate and compare results
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{MDP Formulation}

A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a mathematical framework for modeling decision making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker. An MDP is defined by the tuple $(S, A, P, R, \gamma)$ where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $S$: Set of states
    \item $A$: Set of actions
    \item $P$: Transition probability function
    \item $R$: Reward function
    \item $\gamma$: Discount factor
\end{itemize}

Our custom GridWorld environment follows this framework precisely, providing a controlled environment for studying RL algorithms.

\subsubsection{State Space (S)}

The state space represents all possible configurations of the agent's position in the grid world. We define the state space as:

\begin{equation}
S = \{(i, j) : i, j \in \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\}
\end{equation}

where $(i, j)$ represents the agent's position at row $i$ and column $j$.

\textbf{State Space Properties:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cardinality}: $|S| = 16$ (4×4 grid)
    \item \textbf{Discrete}: Each state is distinct and countable
    \item \textbf{Finite}: Bounded state space enables tabular methods
    \item \textbf{Observable}: Agent has complete information about its state
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Special States:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Start State}: $s_0 = (0, 0)$ - top-left corner
    \item \textbf{Goal State}: $s_g = (3, 3)$ - bottom-right corner
    \item \textbf{Hole States}: $H = \{(1, 1), (2, 2)\}$ - terminal states with negative reward
    \item \textbf{Regular States}: All other positions with neutral reward
\end{itemize}

\textbf{State Encoding:}
For computational efficiency, we encode the 2D position $(i, j)$ as a single integer:
\begin{equation}
\text{state\_id} = 4 \times i + j
\end{equation}

This encoding maps the 2D grid positions to integers in the range $[0, 15]$, enabling efficient array indexing and Q-table representation.

\subsubsection{Action Space (A)}

The action space defines the set of movements available to the agent. We implement a discrete action space with four cardinal directions:

\begin{equation}
A = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Action Definitions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Action 0}: Move up (north) - $(i, j) \rightarrow (i-1, j)$
    \item \textbf{Action 1}: Move down (south) - $(i, j) \rightarrow (i+1, j)$
    \item \textbf{Action 2}: Move left (west) - $(i, j) \rightarrow (i, j-1)$
    \item \textbf{Action 3}: Move right (east) - $(i, j) \rightarrow (i, j+1)$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Action Space Properties:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Discrete}: Finite set of actions
    \item \textbf{Deterministic}: Each action has a predictable outcome
    \item \textbf{Bounded}: Actions are constrained by grid boundaries
    \item \textbf{Symmetric}: All directions have equal probability of selection
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Boundary Handling:}
When an action would move the agent outside the grid boundaries, the agent remains in its current position:
\begin{equation}
\text{next\_state} = \begin{cases}
(\max(0, i-1), j) & \text{if action = 0 and } i > 0 \\
(\min(3, i+1), j) & \text{if action = 1 and } i < 3 \\
(i, \max(0, j-1)) & \text{if action = 2 and } j > 0 \\
(i, \min(3, j+1)) & \text{if action = 3 and } j < 3 \\
(i, j) & \text{otherwise (boundary collision)}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Reward Function (R)}

The reward function provides feedback to guide the agent's learning process. We design a sparse reward structure that encourages goal-directed behavior while penalizing dangerous actions.

\begin{equation}
R(s, a, s') = \begin{cases}
+10 & \text{if } s' = (3, 3) \text{ (goal state)} \\
-1 & \text{if } s' \in \{(1, 1), (2, 2)\} \text{ (hole states)} \\
0 & \text{otherwise (regular transitions)}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Reward Function Design Principles:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Goal Incentive}: Positive reward (+10) for reaching the goal
    \item \textbf{Danger Penalty}: Negative reward (-1) for falling into holes
    \item \textbf{Neutral Transitions}: Zero reward for regular movements
    \item \textbf{Sparse Structure}: Rewards only at terminal states
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Reward Function Properties:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Deterministic}: Same reward for same state transitions
    \item \textbf{Bounded}: Rewards are finite and well-defined
    \item \textbf{Sparse}: Most transitions provide no reward signal
    \item \textbf{Goal-oriented}: Clearly indicates desirable outcomes
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Reward Scaling Considerations:}
The reward magnitudes are chosen to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide clear distinction between good and bad outcomes
    \item Ensure numerical stability in learning algorithms
    \item Balance immediate and long-term rewards
    \item Enable effective value function approximation
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Transition Probability (P)}

The transition probability function defines the dynamics of the environment. In our deterministic GridWorld, transitions are completely predictable given the current state and action.

\begin{equation}
P(s'|s, a) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } s' = \text{next\_state}(s, a) \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

where $\text{next\_state}(s, a)$ is the deterministic state transition function defined earlier.

\textbf{Transition Properties:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Deterministic}: Each state-action pair leads to exactly one next state
    \item \textbf{Markovian}: Next state depends only on current state and action
    \item \textbf{Stationary}: Transition probabilities don't change over time
    \item \textbf{Complete}: All state-action pairs have defined transitions
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Terminal State Handling:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Goal State}: Episode terminates with positive reward
    \item \textbf{Hole States}: Episode terminates with negative reward
    \item \textbf{Regular States}: Episode continues with zero reward
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Markov Property Validation:}
Our environment satisfies the Markov property:
\begin{equation}
P(S_{t+1} = s' | S_t = s, A_t = a, S_{t-1}, A_{t-1}, ...) = P(S_{t+1} = s' | S_t = s, A_t = a)
\end{equation}

This means the future state depends only on the current state and action, not on the history of previous states and actions.

\subsection{Environment Implementation}

\subsubsection{Gymnasium API Compliance}

Our custom environment implements the standard Gymnasium API, ensuring compatibility with existing RL libraries and frameworks. The implementation follows the required interface:

\textbf{Required Methods:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\texttt{reset()}}: Initialize environment to starting state
    \item \textbf{\texttt{step(action)}}: Execute action and return next state, reward, done, info
    \item \textbf{\texttt{render()}}: Visualize current environment state
    \item \textbf{\texttt{close()}}: Clean up environment resources
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Required Attributes:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\texttt{action\_space}}: Defines available actions
    \item \textbf{\texttt{observation\_space}}: Defines state representation
    \item \textbf{\texttt{metadata}}: Environment metadata and configuration
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Implementation Benefits:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Compatibility}: Works with Stable-Baselines3, Ray RLlib, and other libraries
    \item \textbf{Standardization}: Follows established conventions
    \item \textbf{Extensibility}: Easy to modify and extend functionality
    \item \textbf{Testing}: Compatible with standard testing frameworks
\end{itemize}

\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Q-Learning Implementation}

\subsubsection{Q-Learning Algorithm Overview}

Q-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the optimal action-value function $Q^*(s,a)$ without requiring a model of the environment. The algorithm uses the Bellman equation to iteratively update Q-values:

\begin{equation}
Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha [r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\alpha$ is the learning rate
    \item $\gamma$ is the discount factor
    \item $r$ is the immediate reward
    \item $s'$ is the next state
    \item $\max_{a'} Q(s',a')$ is the maximum Q-value for the next state
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Q-Learning Properties:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model-free}: Doesn't require knowledge of transition probabilities
    \item \textbf{Off-policy}: Learns optimal policy while following any exploration policy
    \item \textbf{Convergence}: Guaranteed to converge to optimal Q-values under certain conditions
    \item \textbf{Sample efficiency}: Can learn from individual transitions
\end{itemize}

\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Agent Simulation}

Visualizing the trained agent's behavior is essential for validating the learning process and understanding the learned policy. Our simulation function provides comprehensive insights into agent performance.

\textbf{Simulation Objectives:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Policy Validation}: Verify that the agent follows optimal strategies
    \item \textbf{Performance Assessment}: Measure solution quality and efficiency

A well-trained agent should demonstrate:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Efficient Navigation}: Find shortest path to goal
    \item \textbf{Hole Avoidance}: Steer clear of dangerous states
    \item \textbf{Consistent Performance}: Reliable success across multiple episodes
    \item \textbf{Optimal Policy}: Follow the mathematically optimal strategy
\end{itemize}

    current_state, _ = environment.reset()
    finished = False

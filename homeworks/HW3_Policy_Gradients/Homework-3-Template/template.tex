\section{Task 1: Policy Search: REINFORCE vs. GA [20]}

\subsection{Theoretical Background and Motivation}

Policy gradient methods represent a fundamental paradigm in reinforcement learning that directly optimizes the policy function $\pi_\theta(a|s)$ parameterized by $\theta$. Unlike value-based methods that first learn value functions and then derive policies, policy gradient methods directly optimize the policy to maximize expected return.

\textbf{Mathematical Foundation:}
The policy gradient theorem provides the theoretical foundation for all policy gradient methods. Given a policy $\pi_\theta(a|s)$ parameterized by $\theta$, the objective is to maximize the expected return:

$$J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_\theta}\left[\sum_{t=0}^{T} \gamma^t r_t\right]$$

where $\tau = (s_0, a_0, r_1, s_1, a_1, r_2, \ldots, s_T)$ represents a trajectory sampled from the policy.

The policy gradient theorem states that:
$$\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_\theta}\left[\sum_{t=0}^{T} \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_t|s_t) G_t\right]$$

where $G_t = \sum_{k=t}^{T} \gamma^{k-t} r_k$ is the return from time step $t$.

\textbf{Key Insight:} This remarkable result allows us to estimate gradients using sampled trajectories without requiring knowledge of environment dynamics, making it applicable to model-free reinforcement learning.

\subsection{Question 1:}
How do these two methods differ in terms of their effectiveness for solving reinforcement learning tasks? 

\textbf{Answer:} REINFORCE and Genetic Algorithms (GA) represent fundamentally different paradigms for policy optimization in reinforcement learning, each with distinct advantages and limitations.

\textbf{REINFORCE (Policy Gradient Method):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Gradient-based optimization}: Utilizes the policy gradient theorem to directly optimize policy parameters through gradient ascent, leveraging the mathematical relationship $\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_\theta}[\sum_{t=0}^{T} \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_t|s_t) G_t]$
    
    \textbf{Algorithm Details:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Initialize policy parameters $\theta$ randomly
        \item For each episode:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Sample trajectory $\tau = (s_0, a_0, r_1, s_1, a_1, r_2, \ldots, s_T)$ using $\pi_\theta$
            \item Compute returns $G_t = \sum_{k=t}^{T} \gamma^{k-t} r_k$ for each time step $t$
            \item Compute policy gradient: $\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \sum_{t=0}^{T} \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_t|s_t) G_t$
            \item Update parameters: $\theta \leftarrow \theta + \alpha \nabla_\theta J(\theta)$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{Sample efficiency}: Exploits gradient information for more efficient parameter updates, typically requiring 300-500 episodes for convergence in simple environments. The gradient provides directional information about how to improve the policy.
    
    \item \textbf{On-policy learning}: Must sample trajectories from the current policy, preventing data reuse and limiting sample efficiency. This constraint ensures that the gradient estimates are unbiased but comes at the cost of sample efficiency.
    
    \item \textbf{Continuous optimization}: Employs smooth parameter updates via backpropagation, enabling fine-grained policy adjustments. The continuous nature allows for precise optimization in high-dimensional parameter spaces.
    
    \item \textbf{High variance challenge}: Monte Carlo estimates of returns introduce significant variance, leading to unstable gradient estimates and noisy parameter updates. This variance stems from:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Stochastic environment dynamics
        \item Policy stochasticity
        \item Episodic randomness
        \item Long episode lengths
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Mathematical foundation}: Based on the policy gradient theorem, providing theoretical guarantees for convergence to local optima under certain conditions.
    
    \item \textbf{Implementation considerations}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Requires differentiable policy representations (typically neural networks)
        \item Sensitive to learning rate $\alpha$ - too high causes instability, too low causes slow convergence
        \item Benefits from baseline functions to reduce variance
        \item Can handle both discrete and continuous action spaces
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Genetic Algorithm (Evolutionary Approach):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Population-based search}: Maintains a population of candidate policies and evolves them through selection, crossover, and mutation operations
    
    \textbf{Algorithm Details:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Initialize population of $N$ policies $\{\theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots, \theta_N\}$
        \item For each generation:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Evaluate fitness $f(\theta_i)$ for each policy $\theta_i$ in population
            \item Select parents based on fitness (e.g., tournament selection, roulette wheel)
            \item Create offspring through crossover: $\theta_{child} = \text{crossover}(\theta_{parent1}, \theta_{parent2})$
            \item Apply mutation: $\theta_{mutated} = \text{mutation}(\theta_{child})$
            \item Replace population with new generation
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{Derivative-free optimization}: Operates without gradient information, making it suitable for non-differentiable policy representations. This includes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Discrete policies
        \item Symbolic policies
        \item Rule-based policies
        \item Non-differentiable neural network architectures
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Parallelizable evaluation}: Can evaluate multiple policies simultaneously, leveraging parallel computing resources effectively. This makes GA particularly suitable for:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Distributed computing environments
        \item GPU-accelerated evaluation
        \item Cloud computing platforms
        \item Multi-core processors
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Discrete optimization paradigm}: Uses discrete operations (mutation, crossover) rather than continuous gradient updates. Common operations include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Mutation}: Random changes to policy parameters
        \item \textbf{Crossover}: Combining features from two parent policies
        \item \textbf{Selection}: Choosing policies based on fitness
        \item \textbf{Elitism}: Preserving best policies across generations
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Global search capability}: Random mutations enable escape from local optima, potentially finding globally optimal solutions. This is particularly valuable in:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Rugged fitness landscapes
        \item Multi-modal optimization problems
        \item Non-convex policy spaces
        \item Environments with multiple optimal solutions
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Evolutionary dynamics}: Implements natural selection principles where fitter policies have higher probability of reproduction. Key concepts include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Fitness function}: Measures policy performance (e.g., average return)
        \item \textbf{Selection pressure}: Controls exploration vs exploitation balance
        \item \textbf{Genetic diversity}: Maintains population diversity to prevent premature convergence
        \item \textbf{Adaptation}: Population adapts to environment characteristics over time
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Implementation considerations}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Requires defining appropriate mutation and crossover operators
        \item Population size affects exploration capability and computational cost
        \item Selection pressure must be balanced to avoid premature convergence
        \item Suitable for both discrete and continuous policy representations
        \item Can handle multi-objective optimization naturally
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Question 2:}
Discuss the key differences in their \textbf{performance}, \textbf{convergence rates}, and \textbf{stability}. 

\textbf{Answer:} The comparative analysis reveals significant differences across multiple dimensions that impact their practical applicability.

\textbf{Performance Analysis:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{REINFORCE superiority}: Achieves superior final performance (85-95\% success rate) due to gradient-based optimization that efficiently exploits reward signals and enables precise policy refinement
    \item \textbf{GA limitations}: Struggles with fine-tuning (60-75\% success rate) but demonstrates capability to discover diverse solution strategies through evolutionary exploration
    \item \textbf{Environment dependency}: REINFORCE excels in smooth, differentiable reward landscapes typical of continuous control tasks, while GA shows advantages in discrete, combinatorial optimization problems with rugged fitness landscapes
    \item \textbf{Mathematical foundation}: REINFORCE's performance is theoretically grounded in the policy gradient theorem, providing convergence guarantees to local optima
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Convergence Rate Comparison:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{REINFORCE efficiency}: Demonstrates faster initial convergence (300-500 episodes) by leveraging gradient information to guide parameter updates toward higher-reward regions of the policy space
    \item \textbf{GA exploration phase}: Requires longer convergence periods (500-1000+ episodes) due to reliance on random search mechanisms without gradient guidance
    \item \textbf{Predictability}: REINFORCE exhibits more predictable convergence trajectories with smoother learning curves, while GA convergence depends heavily on population size, mutation rates, and selection pressure
    \item \textbf{Sample complexity}: REINFORCE requires fewer environment interactions per effective policy update, making it more sample-efficient
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Stability Characteristics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{REINFORCE variance challenge}: High variance in Monte Carlo gradient estimates leads to unstable training dynamics, manifesting as erratic learning curves and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices
    \item \textbf{GA stability advantage}: Population-based averaging provides inherent stability, resulting in smoother but slower progress through the policy space
    \item \textbf{Hyperparameter sensitivity}: REINFORCE requires careful tuning of learning rates, baseline functions, and network architectures, while GA demonstrates greater robustness to parameter settings but necessitates larger population sizes for effective exploration
    \item \textbf{Convergence reliability}: GA's evolutionary approach provides more consistent convergence across different random seeds, while REINFORCE may exhibit significant run-to-run variability
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Question 3:}
Additionally, explore how each method handles exploration and exploitation, and suggest situations where one might be preferred over the other. 

\textbf{Answer:} The exploration-exploitation trade-off represents a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning, and each method addresses this balance through distinct mechanisms.

\textbf{Exploration vs Exploitation Mechanisms:}

\textbf{REINFORCE Exploration Strategy:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Natural stochastic exploration}: The inherent stochasticity of policy $\pi_\theta(a|s)$ provides continuous exploration throughout training, with exploration intensity controlled by policy entropy $H(\pi_\theta) = -\sum_a \pi_\theta(a|s) \log \pi_\theta(a|s)$
    \item \textbf{Gradient-guided exploitation}: Policy gradient ascent $\theta \leftarrow \theta + \alpha \nabla_\theta J(\theta)$ efficiently exploits promising directions in parameter space, directing updates toward higher-reward regions
    \item \textbf{Adaptive balance}: The exploration-exploitation balance is dynamically controlled through learning rate $\alpha$ and policy entropy regularization, enabling fine-tuning of the trade-off
    \item \textbf{Local optimization limitation}: Gradient-based updates may converge to local optima, potentially missing globally optimal policies in complex reward landscapes
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Genetic Algorithm Exploration Strategy:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mutation-driven exploration}: Random mutations introduce novel policy variations, providing systematic exploration of the policy space through controlled randomness
    \item \textbf{Selection pressure exploitation}: Fitness-based selection mechanisms exploit high-performing policies by increasing their reproduction probability, concentrating search effort on promising regions
    \item \textbf{Population diversity maintenance}: The population structure maintains genetic diversity, preventing premature convergence and enabling sustained exploration throughout evolution
    \item \textbf{Global search advantage}: Random mutations enable escape from local optima, providing access to globally optimal solutions that gradient methods might miss
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Method Selection Guidelines:}

\textbf{Choose REINFORCE when:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Differentiable policy representations}: Neural network policies enable gradient computation and efficient parameter updates
    \item \textbf{Sample efficiency requirements}: Limited environment interactions necessitate efficient learning algorithms that exploit gradient information
    \item \textbf{Smooth reward landscapes}: Continuous, differentiable reward functions enable effective gradient-based optimization
    \item \textbf{Continuous action spaces}: Natural handling of continuous actions through Gaussian or other continuous distributions
    \item \textbf{Computational constraints}: Limited computational resources favor gradient-based methods over population-based approaches
    \item \textbf{Real-time learning}: Online learning scenarios benefit from REINFORCE's ability to update policies incrementally
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Choose Genetic Algorithm when:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Non-differentiable policies}: Discrete, symbolic, or other non-differentiable policy representations require derivative-free optimization
    \item \textbf{Discrete action spaces}: Discrete action spaces with complex action selection logic benefit from GA's discrete optimization paradigm
    \item \textbf{Rugged fitness landscapes}: Environments with multiple local optima and complex reward structures benefit from GA's global search capabilities
    \item \textbf{Parallel computing availability}: Access to parallel computing resources enables efficient population evaluation and evolution
    \item \textbf{Diverse solution requirements}: Need for multiple distinct solution strategies or robust policy ensembles
    \item \textbf{Multi-objective optimization}: GA naturally handles multiple competing objectives through Pareto-optimal solution discovery
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Hybrid Approaches:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Evolutionary policy gradients}: Combine GA's global search with REINFORCE's local optimization for improved performance
    \item \textbf{Population-based training}: Use GA for hyperparameter optimization while employing REINFORCE for policy learning
    \item \textbf{Curriculum learning}: Start with GA for coarse policy discovery, then refine with REINFORCE for fine-tuning
\end{itemize}

\section{Task 2: REINFORCE: Baseline vs. No Baseline [25]}

\subsection{Theoretical Background: Variance Reduction in Policy Gradients}

The high variance problem in policy gradient methods is one of the most significant challenges in reinforcement learning. Understanding and addressing this variance is crucial for practical applications of policy gradient algorithms.

\textbf{The Variance Problem:}
The policy gradient estimate $\hat{\nabla}_\theta J(\theta) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{t=0}^{T_i} \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_{i,t}|s_{i,t}) G_{i,t}$ has high variance due to:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Monte Carlo estimation}: Returns $G_t$ are estimated from single trajectories
    \item \textbf{Policy stochasticity}: Random action selection introduces additional variance
    \item \textbf{Environment stochasticity}: Random transitions and rewards contribute to variance
    \item \textbf{Episodic variance}: Different episode lengths and outcomes create variance
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Mathematical Analysis of Variance:}
The variance of the gradient estimate can be decomposed as:
$$\text{Var}[\hat{\nabla}_\theta J(\theta)] = \frac{1}{N} \text{Var}[\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s) G] + \frac{1}{N^2} \sum_{i \neq j} \text{Cov}[\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_i|s_i) G_i, \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_j|s_j) G_j]$$

The first term dominates and decreases as $1/N$, but the per-sample variance remains high without proper techniques.

\textbf{Baseline Solution:}
A baseline $b(s)$ can be subtracted from returns without introducing bias:
$$\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}[\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s) (G - b(s))]$$

The unbiasedness follows from:
$$\mathbb{E}[\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s) b(s)] = \sum_a \pi_\theta(a|s) \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s) b(s) = b(s) \nabla_\theta \sum_a \pi_\theta(a|s) = b(s) \nabla_\theta 1 = 0$$

\subsection{Question 1:}

How are the observation and action spaces defined in the CartPole environment?
\vspace*{0.3cm}

\textbf{Answer:} The CartPole-v1 environment represents a classic control problem with well-defined observation and action spaces that make it ideal for studying policy gradient methods.

\textbf{Observation Space Specification:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dimensionality}: 4-dimensional continuous state space $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^4$
    \item \textbf{State components}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Cart position}: $x \in [-4.8, 4.8]$ meters, representing horizontal displacement from center
        \item \textbf{Cart velocity}: $\dot{x} \in [-\infty, \infty]$ m/s, representing horizontal velocity
        \item \textbf{Pole angle}: $\theta \in [-0.418, 0.418]$ radians (±24°), representing angular displacement from vertical
        \item \textbf{Pole angular velocity}: $\dot{\theta} \in [-\infty, \infty]$ rad/s, representing angular velocity
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Initialization}: States initialized with small random values near zero to ensure diverse starting conditions
    \item \textbf{State normalization}: Continuous nature enables direct neural network processing without discretization
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Action Space Definition:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Action type}: Discrete action space $\mathcal{A} = \{0, 1\}$
    \item \textbf{Action semantics}: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $a = 0$: Apply force of -1 Newton (push cart to the left)
        \item $a = 1$: Apply force of +1 Newton (push cart to the right)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Control mechanism}: Binary force application enables simple policy representation while maintaining sufficient control authority
    \item \textbf{Policy compatibility}: Discrete actions work well with categorical distributions in policy gradient methods
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Reward Structure and Termination:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reward function}: $r_t = +1$ for every timestep the pole remains upright, providing dense positive feedback
    \item \textbf{Episode termination conditions}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Angle threshold}: $|\theta| > 0.209$ radians (±12°) - pole falls too far from vertical
        \item \textbf{Position threshold}: $|x| > 2.4$ meters - cart moves too far from center
        \item \textbf{Time limit}: Episode length exceeds 500 steps - maximum episode duration
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Success criterion}: Episode considered solved when average reward ≥ 475 over 100 consecutive episodes
    \item \textbf{Reward characteristics}: Dense rewards facilitate learning while termination conditions prevent infinite episodes
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Environment Dynamics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Physics simulation}: Implements realistic cart-pole dynamics with gravity, friction, and momentum
    \item \textbf{Deterministic transitions}: Given state and action, next state is deterministic (no stochasticity in dynamics)
    \item \textbf{Control challenge}: Requires learning to balance pole while keeping cart within bounds
    \item \textbf{Policy gradient suitability}: Continuous state space and discrete actions make it ideal for REINFORCE algorithm testing
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Question 2:}

What is the role of the discount factor $(\gamma)$ in reinforcement learning, and what happens when $\gamma$=0 or $\gamma$=1?
\vspace*{0.3cm}

\textbf{Answer:} The discount factor $\gamma \in [0, 1]$ is a fundamental hyperparameter in reinforcement learning that controls the temporal horizon of decision-making and ensures mathematical tractability of infinite-horizon problems.

\textbf{Fundamental Role of Discount Factor:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Temporal weighting}: Controls the relative importance of immediate versus future rewards through the return calculation $G_t = \sum_{k=t}^{T} \gamma^{k-t} r_k$
    \item \textbf{Convergence guarantee}: Ensures finite returns for infinite-horizon problems when $\gamma < 1$, preventing divergence in value function estimates
    \item \textbf{Policy optimization influence}: Affects which actions are considered optimal by changing the value of delayed rewards
    \item \textbf{Mathematical necessity}: Required for theoretical convergence guarantees in most RL algorithms
    \item \textbf{Behavioral interpretation}: Reflects the agent's "patience" or preference for immediate versus delayed gratification
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Mathematical Analysis:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Return formulation}: $G_t = r_{t+1} + \gamma r_{t+2} + \gamma^2 r_{t+3} + \ldots + \gamma^{T-t-1} r_T$
    \item \textbf{Value function definition}: $V^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}_\pi[G_t | S_t = s] = \mathbb{E}_\pi[\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k r_{t+k+1} | S_t = s]$
    \item \textbf{Bellman equation}: $V^\pi(s) = \sum_a \pi(a|s) \sum_{s',r} p(s',r|s,a)[r + \gamma V^\pi(s')]$
    \item \textbf{Policy gradient impact}: $\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_\pi[\sum_{t=0}^{T} \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_t|s_t) G_t]$ where $G_t$ depends on $\gamma$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{When $\gamma = 0$ (Myopic Behavior):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Return calculation}: $G_t = r_{t+1}$ - only immediate reward matters
    \item \textbf{Behavioral implications}: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Agent becomes completely myopic, ignoring long-term consequences
        \item May lead to suboptimal policies that sacrifice long-term gains for immediate rewards
        \item Useful for immediate reward maximization scenarios
        \item Eliminates credit assignment problem for delayed rewards
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{CartPole example}: Agent might not learn to balance for extended periods, focusing only on immediate survival
    \item \textbf{Mathematical properties}: Guarantees finite returns but loses long-term planning capability
    \item \textbf{Practical applications}: Real-time systems where only immediate feedback is available
\end{itemize}

\textbf{When $\gamma = 1$ (Infinite Horizon):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Return calculation}: $G_t = \sum_{k=t}^{T} r_k$ - all future rewards weighted equally
    \item \textbf{Behavioral implications}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Agent values all future rewards equally, enabling long-term planning
        \item Optimal for finite-horizon episodic tasks where episodes have natural termination
        \item May not converge for infinite-horizon continuing tasks without proper conditions
        \item Enables learning of complex, long-term strategies
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{CartPole example}: Agent learns to balance for maximum possible time, considering long-term stability
    \item \textbf{Convergence considerations}: Requires episodic tasks or special conditions for convergence
    \item \textbf{Mathematical challenges}: May lead to infinite returns in continuing tasks
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Optimal $\gamma$ Selection Guidelines:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Episodic tasks}: $\gamma = 0.95$ to $0.99$ provides good balance between immediate and long-term rewards
    \item \textbf{CartPole environment}: $\gamma = 0.95$ optimal, balancing immediate survival with long-term stability
    \item \textbf{Continuing tasks}: $\gamma < 1$ required for convergence, typically $0.9$ to $0.99$
    \item \textbf{Real-time constraints}: Lower $\gamma$ values (0.8-0.9) for systems requiring quick responses
    \item \textbf{Long-term planning}: Higher $\gamma$ values (0.98-0.99) for tasks requiring extensive foresight
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Impact on Policy Gradient Methods:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Gradient estimation}: $\gamma$ affects the magnitude and variance of return estimates $G_t$

    \item \textbf{Exploration vs exploitation}: $\gamma$ influences the balance between immediate exploration and long-term exploitation
    \item \textbf{Baseline effectiveness}: Baseline functions become more important with higher $\gamma$ due to increased return variance
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Question 3:}

Why is a baseline introduced in the REINFORCE algorithm, and how does it contribute to training stability?
\vspace*{0.3cm}

\textbf{Answer:} The introduction of baselines in REINFORCE addresses the critical problem of high variance in policy gradient estimates, which is the primary limitation of Monte Carlo policy gradient methods.

\textbf{The High Variance Problem in REINFORCE:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Monte Carlo variance}: Returns $G_t = \sum_{k=t}^{T} \gamma^{k-t} r_k$ exhibit high variance due to stochastic environment dynamics and policy stochasticity
    \item \textbf{Gradient estimation challenge}: The policy gradient $\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_\theta}[\sum_{t=0}^{T} \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_t|s_t) G_t]$ multiplies high-variance returns with log-probability gradients
    \item \textbf{Training instability}: High variance leads to erratic parameter updates, slow convergence, and poor sample efficiency
    \item \textbf{Sample complexity}: Requires many episodes (500-1000+) for stable gradient estimates without baseline
    \item \textbf{Convergence issues}: Noisy gradients may prevent convergence to optimal policies or cause convergence to suboptimal local minima
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Baseline Solution and Mathematical Foundation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unbiased estimator}: The baseline-modified gradient $\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_\theta}[\sum_{t=0}^{T} \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_t|s_t) (G_t - b(s_t))]$ remains unbiased
    \item \textbf{Variance reduction}: Subtracting baseline $b(s_t)$ reduces gradient variance without introducing bias
    \item \textbf{Mathematical proof of unbiasedness}:
    \begin{align}
    \mathbb{E}[\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s) b(s)] &= \sum_a \pi_\theta(a|s) \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s) b(s) \\
    &= b(s) \nabla_\theta \sum_a \pi_\theta(a|s) \\
    &= b(s) \nabla_\theta 1 = 0
    \end{align}
    \item \textbf{Key insight}: Any function $b(s)$ that doesn't depend on action $a$ can be subtracted without affecting the expected gradient
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Common Baseline Strategies:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Constant baseline}: $b(s) = \mathbb{E}[G_t]$ - average return across all episodes
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Simple to implement and compute
        \item Provides moderate variance reduction
        \item Doesn't exploit state-specific information
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{State-value baseline}: $b(s) = V^\pi(s)$ - optimal choice for variance reduction
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Maximizes variance reduction among all possible baselines
        \item Requires learning value function $V^\pi(s)$
        \item Leads to advantage function: $A(s,a) = Q(s,a) - V(s) = G_t - V(s)$
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantage estimation}: $A(s,a) = G_t - V(s)$ provides optimal credit assignment
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Positive advantage: action better than average
        \item Negative advantage: action worse than average
        \item Zero advantage: action average performance
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Training Stability Improvements:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Variance reduction}: 50-70\% reduction in gradient variance with proper baseline implementation
    \item \textbf{Faster convergence}: 300-500 episodes vs 500-1000 episodes without baseline
    \item \textbf{Smoother learning curves}: Reduced oscillations and erratic behavior in reward progression
    \item \textbf{Better gradient estimates}: More reliable parameter updates leading to stable policy improvement
    \item \textbf{Improved sample efficiency}: Fewer episodes required to reach target performance levels
    \item \textbf{Hyperparameter robustness}: Less sensitive to learning rate and other hyperparameter choices
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Implementation Considerations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Baseline network architecture}: Separate neural network to estimate $V(s)$ with similar architecture to policy network
    \item \textbf{Training procedure}: Update baseline using mean squared error loss: $L_{baseline} = \mathbb{E}[(V(s) - G_t)^2]$
    \item \textbf{Policy loss modification}: $L_{policy} = -\mathbb{E}[\log \pi_\theta(a|s) (G_t - V(s))]$
    \item \textbf{Combined optimization}: Joint training of policy and baseline networks with appropriate learning rates
    \item \textbf{Baseline accuracy}: Poor baseline estimates can actually increase variance, requiring careful training
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Theoretical Analysis:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Variance decomposition}: $\text{Var}[\nabla_\theta J(\theta)] = \text{Var}[\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s) G_t] - \text{Cov}[\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s), G_t]^2$
    \item \textbf{Optimal baseline}: $b^*(s) = \frac{\mathbb{E}[(\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s))^2 G_t]}{\mathbb{E}[(\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s))^2]}$
    \item \textbf{State-value optimality}: When baseline equals state value function, variance reduction is maximized
    \item \textbf{Convergence guarantees}: Baseline maintains convergence properties while improving practical performance
\end{itemize}

\section{Task 3: REINFORCE in a continuous action space [20]}

\subsection{Theoretical Background: Continuous Action Spaces in Policy Gradients}

Continuous action spaces present unique challenges and opportunities for policy gradient methods. Unlike discrete actions that can be represented with categorical distributions, continuous actions require probability distributions that can be sampled from and differentiated.

\textbf{Policy Representation for Continuous Actions:}
The most common approach is to use Gaussian policies:
$$\pi_\theta(a|s) = \mathcal{N}(\mu_\theta(s), \sigma_\theta^2(s))$$

where $\mu_\theta(s)$ and $\sigma_\theta(s)$ are neural networks that output the mean and standard deviation of the action distribution.

\textbf{Log Probability Computation:}
For a Gaussian policy, the log probability is:
$$\log \pi_\theta(a|s) = -\frac{1}{2} \log(2\pi\sigma^2) - \frac{(a - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}$$

\textbf{Gradient Computation:}
The policy gradient becomes:
$$\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s) = \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s) \cdot G$$

where the gradient can be computed using automatic differentiation.

\textbf{Action Bounds and Scaling:}
Continuous actions often need to be bounded to valid ranges. Common approaches include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Tanh activation}: $a = \tanh(\mu_\theta(s) + \sigma_\theta(s) \cdot \epsilon)$
    \item \textbf{Sigmoid scaling}: $a = a_{min} + (a_{max} - a_{min}) \cdot \sigma(\mu_\theta(s))$
    \item \textbf{Action clipping}: Clipping actions to valid ranges after sampling
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Exploration in Continuous Spaces:}
Exploration is controlled by the standard deviation $\sigma_\theta(s)$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{High $\sigma$}: More exploration, higher variance
    \item \textbf{Low $\sigma$}: Less exploration, lower variance
    \item \textbf{Adaptive $\sigma$}: Can be learned or scheduled
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Question 1:}

How are the observation and action spaces defined in the MountainCarContinuous environment?
\vspace*{0.3cm}

\textbf{Answer:} The MountainCarContinuous environment represents a challenging continuous control problem that tests the ability of policy gradient methods to handle continuous action spaces and sparse reward scenarios.

\textbf{Observation Space Specification:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dimensionality}: 2-dimensional continuous state space $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$
    \item \textbf{State components}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Car position}: $x \in [-1.2, 0.6]$ meters, representing horizontal displacement from starting position
        \item \textbf{Car velocity}: $\dot{x} \in [-0.07, 0.07]$ m/s, representing horizontal velocity with bounded range
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Initialization}: Car starts at random position near the bottom of the hill (typically $x \approx -0.5$)
    \item \textbf{Goal specification}: Reach the flag positioned at $x = 0.5$ meters

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Action Space Definition:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Action type}: Continuous action space $\mathcal{A} = [-1, 1]$
    \item \textbf{Action semantics}: Force applied to the car in Newtons
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Negative values} ($a < 0$): Push car to the left (toward the hill, building momentum)
        \item \textbf{Positive values} ($a > 0$): Push car to the right (away from the hill, toward goal)
        \item \textbf{Magnitude} ($|a|$): Strength of the applied force
        \item \textbf{Zero} ($a = 0$): No force applied, car moves under gravity and momentum
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Control precision}: Continuous actions enable fine-grained control over force application
    \item \textbf{Policy compatibility}: Requires continuous probability distributions (e.g., Gaussian) for action sampling
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Environment Dynamics and Physics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Physics simulation}: Implements realistic car dynamics with gravity, friction, and momentum conservation
    \item \textbf{Momentum requirement}: Car must build sufficient momentum through back-and-forth movements to reach the goal
    \item \textbf{Energy conservation}: Potential energy conversion to kinetic energy drives the car up the hill
    \item \textbf{Control challenge}: Requires learning complex temporal sequences of actions to build momentum
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Reward Structure and Termination:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Goal reward}: +100 when reaching the flag at $x \geq 0.5$
    \item \textbf{Step penalty}: -0.1 for each timestep (encourages efficiency and prevents infinite episodes)
    \item \textbf{Action penalty}: $-0.1 \times a^2$ (penalizes large actions, encouraging energy-efficient control)
    \item \textbf{Total reward function}: $R = 100 \cdot \mathbb{1}_{\text{goal}} - 0.1 - 0.1 \times a^2$
    \item \textbf{Episode termination conditions}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Goal reached}: $x \geq 0.5$ (successful completion)
        \item \textbf{Maximum steps}: 999 steps (time limit to prevent infinite episodes)
        \item \textbf{Position bounds}: $x < -1.2$ (rare, car falls off the left edge)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Learning Challenges:}

\vspace*{0.3cm}

\textbf{Answer:} The optimal energy-efficient strategy for MountainCarContinuous involves a sophisticated momentum-building approach that leverages the physics of the environment to minimize energy expenditure while maximizing the probability of reaching the goal.

\textbf{Optimal Energy-Efficient Strategy - "Momentum Building with Minimal Energy":}

\textbf{Phase 1: Initial Momentum Building (Steps 1-40)}
\begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Goal}: Establish sufficient leftward velocity for momentum transfer
    \item \textbf{Position trajectory}: $x$ decreases from initial position ($\approx -0.5$) toward $x \approx -1.0$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Phase 2: Momentum Transfer and Direction Change (Steps 41-80)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Action sequence}: Gradually transition from negative to positive force ($a: -0.6 \rightarrow +0.4$)

        \item Phase 3 (ascent): $\approx 10-15$ energy units
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Energy efficiency ratio}: $\frac{\text{Goal Reward}}{\text{Energy Cost}} = \frac{100}{50} = 2.0$

\section{Task 4: Policy Gradient Drawbacks [25]}

\subsection{Theoretical Background: Limitations of Policy Gradient Methods}

While policy gradient methods have theoretical elegance and practical applications, they suffer from several fundamental limitations that affect their performance and applicability. Understanding these limitations is crucial for choosing appropriate algorithms and developing improvements.

\textbf{Fundamental Limitations:}

\textbf{1. High Variance Problem:}
Policy gradient methods suffer from high variance in gradient estimates due to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Monte Carlo estimation of returns
    \item Policy stochasticity
    \item Environment stochasticity
    \item Long episode lengths
\end{itemize}

The variance scales as $O(T^2)$ where $T$ is episode length, making it particularly problematic for long episodes.

\textbf{2. Sample Inefficiency:}
On-policy learning requires fresh samples from the current policy, preventing data reuse and leading to poor sample efficiency compared to off-policy methods.

\textbf{3. Local Optima:}
Gradient ascent may converge to local optima, missing globally optimal policies. This is particularly problematic in:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Non-convex policy spaces
    \item Multi-modal reward landscapes
    \item Environments with multiple optimal solutions
\end{itemize}

\textbf{4. Credit Assignment Problem:}
Attributing delayed rewards to specific actions becomes increasingly difficult with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Longer episode lengths
    \item Sparse reward structures
    \item Complex temporal dependencies
\end{itemize}

\textbf{5. Hyperparameter Sensitivity:}
Policy gradient methods are sensitive to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Learning rate
    \item Baseline choice
    \item Policy architecture
    \item Exploration parameters
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Comparison with Value-Based Methods:}
Value-based methods (like DQN) often outperform policy gradient methods in:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Discrete action spaces
    \item Environments with sparse rewards
    \item Sample efficiency requirements
    \item Training stability
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Question 1:}

\newline
Explain the specific difficulties that arise in this environment. How do these challenges affect the learning process for both DQN and Policy Gradient methods?

\textbf{Answer:} Frozen Lake presents a deceptively simple environment that introduces several fundamental challenges that test the capabilities of reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly highlighting the differences between value-based and policy-based approaches.

\textbf{Primary Environmental Challenges:}

\textbf{1. Sparse Reward Structure:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reward sparsity}: Only +1 reward at the goal, 0 reward everywhere else
    \item \textbf{Learning signal weakness}: Minimal feedback makes it difficult to learn which actions lead to success
    \item \textbf{Exploration requirement}: Agent must explore extensively to discover the reward
    \item \textbf{Credit assignment difficulty}: Delayed reward makes it challenging to attribute success to specific actions
    \item \textbf{Algorithm impact}: Affects both algorithms but DQN handles it better through value propagation
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. Exploration Challenge and Sample Efficiency:}

    \item \textbf{Sample complexity}: High sample requirements due to sparse rewards and exploration needs
\end{itemize}

\textbf{3. Stochastic Environment Dynamics (Slippery=True):}

    \item \textbf{DQN resilience}: Experience replay helps escape local optima through diverse experience
    \item \textbf{Convergence challenges}: Both algorithms may converge to suboptimal policies
\end{itemize}

\textbf{6. State Space and Action Space Characteristics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Discrete state space}: 16 states (4×4 grid) - small but sufficient for complexity
    \item \textbf{Discrete action space}: 4 actions (up, down, left, right) - simple but requires coordination
    \item \textbf{Deterministic vs stochastic}: Slippery version much harder than deterministic version
    \item \textbf{Episode termination}: Episodes end at goal or hole, limiting learning opportunities
    \item \textbf{Reward structure}: Binary reward makes learning signal weak
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Algorithm-Specific Challenge Responses:}

\textbf{DQN Response to Challenges:}

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Environment-Specific Difficulties:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Deceptive simplicity}: Appears simple but contains complex learning challenges
    \item \textbf{Path dependency}: Success requires learning specific sequences of actions
    \item \textbf{Risk-reward trade-off}: Must balance risk of falling into holes with reward of reaching goal
    \item \textbf{Memory requirements}: Agent must remember which paths lead to holes vs goal

    \item \textbf{Specialized applications}: Choose based on specific requirements (continuous actions, stochastic policies, etc.)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conclusion:}
While unlimited sampling reduces the importance of sample efficiency, DQN remains the preferred choice for most scenarios due to its superior stability, reliability, and performance. The choice between DQN and REINFORCE should be based on environment characteristics (discrete vs continuous actions) and specific requirements (stochastic policies, non-differentiable environments) rather than sampling constraints. For optimal results, consider hybrid actor-critic approaches that combine the benefits of both paradigms.

        "\n",
        "A common way of doing exploration is to visit states with a large prediction error of some quantity, for instance, the TD error or even random functions.  \n",
        "The RND algorithm ([Exploration by Random Network Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12894)) aims at encouraging exploration by asking the exploration policy to more frequently undertake transitions where the prediction error of a random neural network function is high.\n",
        "\n",
        "Formally, let $f^*_\\theta(s')$ be a randomly chosen vector-valued function represented by a neural network.  \n",
        "RND trains another neural network, $\\hat{f}_\\phi(s')$, to match the predictions of $f^*_\\theta(s')$ under the distribution of datapoints in the buffer, as shown below:\n",

        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "If a transition $(s, a, s')$ is in the distribution of the data buffer, the prediction error $\\mathcal{E}_\\phi(s')$ is expected to be small.  \n",
        "On the other hand, for all unseen state-action tuples, it is expected to be large.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice, RND uses two critics:\n",
        "- an exploitation critic $Q_R(s,a)$, which estimates returns based on the true rewards,\n",
        "- and an exploration critic $Q_E(s,a)$, which estimates returns based on the exploration bonuses.\n",

It manages action selection, GAE (Generalized Advantage Estimation), reward normalization, and model training. <br>➡️ You will modify this file to implement the intrinsic reward and RND loss functions. |\n",
        "| `model.py`    | **Neural network architectures.** This defines the structure of the policy network (used for action selection) and the two RND networks — Target and Predictor. These networks process observations and output value estimates and policy distributions. <br>➡️ You will define the structure of the `TargetModel` and `PredictorModel` classes here and implement proper initialization. |\n",

        "| `config.py`   | **Experiment settings.** It defines all training hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, gamma, etc.) and parses command-line flags such as `--train_from_scratch` or `--do_test`. This ensures experiments are configurable without touching main code. |\n",
        "| `logger.py`   | **Logging training metrics.** Records performance data like losses, episode rewards, and value function explained variances into TensorBoard. This helps you visually inspect whether the agent is learning or not. |\n",

        "| `runner.py`     | **Parallel environment interaction.** Runs a Gym environment in a separate process using torch.multiprocessing. It communicates with the main process to exchange observations and actions, enabling parallel experience collection. Supports episode reset and optional rendering. |\n",

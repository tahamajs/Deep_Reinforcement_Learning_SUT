\section{Task 1: Monte Carlo Tree Search}

\subsection{Task Overview}
This comprehensive implementation explores \textbf{Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)}, a powerful planning algorithm that combines tree search with Monte Carlo simulation to solve complex decision-making problems. MCTS has achieved remarkable success in domains ranging from game playing (AlphaGo, AlphaZero) to robotics and resource allocation.

The primary objective is to develop a deep understanding of MCTS through:

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Questions}

\subsubsection{MCTS Fundamentals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{What are the four main phases of MCTS (Selection, Expansion, Simulation, Backpropagation), and what is the conceptual purpose of each phase?}
    
    \textbf{Answer:} MCTS operates through four distinct phases that work together to build an efficient search tree:
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Selection}: Starting from the root, traverse the tree using a tree policy (typically UCB1) until reaching a leaf node. The purpose is to balance exploration of promising paths with exploitation of known good moves. The UCB1 formula guides this selection:
        \[UCB1(s,a) = Q(s,a) + c\sqrt{\frac{\ln N(s)}{N(s,a)}}\]
        where the first term promotes exploitation and the second term encourages exploration of less-visited actions.
        
        \item \textbf{Expansion}: When reaching a leaf node that is not terminal, add one or more child nodes to expand the tree. This phase grows the search tree incrementally, focusing computational resources on promising regions of the state space.
        
        \item \textbf{Simulation (Rollout)}: From the newly expanded node (or leaf if terminal), play out a complete game using a default policy (often random) until reaching a terminal state. This provides an estimate of the value of the position without requiring perfect evaluation functions.
        
        \item \textbf{Backpropagation}: Propagate the simulation result back up the path taken during selection, updating visit counts and value estimates for all nodes in the path. This ensures that promising moves accumulate higher values and visit counts over time.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{How does MCTS balance exploration and exploitation in its node selection strategy (i.e., how does the UCB formula address this balance)?}
    
    \textbf{Answer:} MCTS achieves the exploration-exploitation balance through the UCB1 formula:
    \[UCB1(s,a) = Q(s,a) + c\sqrt{\frac{\ln N(s)}{N(s,a)}}\]
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Exploitation Term} $Q(s,a)$: Represents the average value of taking action $a$ from state $s$. Higher values indicate better-performing actions that should be exploited more frequently.
        
        \item \textbf{Exploration Term} $c\sqrt{\frac{\ln N(s)}{N(s,a)}}$: Encourages exploration of less-visited actions. The term grows as:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $N(s)$ increases (more visits to the parent state)
            \item $N(s,a)$ decreases (fewer visits to this specific action)
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Exploration Constant} $c$: Controls the balance between exploration and exploitation. Typical values:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $c = \sqrt{2}$: Theoretical optimum for UCB1
            \item $c < \sqrt{2}$: More exploitative behavior
            \item $c > \sqrt{2}$: More exploratory behavior
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
    This balance ensures that MCTS doesn't get stuck in local optima while still focusing computational resources on promising regions of the search space.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Tree Policy and Rollouts}
\begin{itemize} 
   \item \textbf{Why do we run multiple simulations from each node rather than a single simulation?}
   
   \textbf{Answer:} Running multiple simulations is crucial for several reasons:
   
   \begin{enumerate}
       \item \textbf{Statistical Reliability}: A single simulation provides only one sample from a potentially noisy distribution. Multiple simulations allow us to:
       \begin{itemize}
           \item Estimate the true expected value more accurately
           \item Reduce variance in value estimates
           \item Build confidence in the quality of different moves
       \end{itemize}
       
       \item \textbf{Law of Large Numbers}: As the number of simulations increases, the sample mean converges to the true expected value. This is particularly important in games with:
       \begin{itemize}
           \item Stochastic elements (random events, opponent moves)
           \item Complex position evaluation
           \item Multiple possible outcomes
       \end{itemize}
       
       \item \textbf{UCB1 Requirements}: The UCB1 formula assumes that we have multiple samples to compute reliable statistics. The visit count $N(s,a)$ and average value $Q(s,a)$ become more meaningful with more simulations.
       
       \item \textbf{Tree Growth}: Multiple simulations allow the tree to grow more systematically, exploring different branches and building a more comprehensive view of the game tree.
   \end{enumerate}
   
   \item \textbf{What role do random rollouts (or simulated playouts) play in estimating the value of a position?}
   
   \textbf{Answer:} Random rollouts serve as a crucial evaluation mechanism in MCTS:
   
   \begin{enumerate}
       \item \textbf{Heuristic-Free Evaluation}: Random rollouts provide position evaluation without requiring hand-crafted evaluation functions. This is particularly valuable in:
       \begin{itemize}
           \item Complex games where evaluation functions are difficult to design
           \item New domains where expert knowledge is limited
           \item Situations where perfect evaluation is computationally infeasible
       \end{itemize}
       
       \item \textbf{Monte Carlo Estimation}: Each rollout represents a random sample from the distribution of possible game outcomes. By averaging many rollouts, we approximate the true expected value:
       \[V(s) \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} R_i\]
       where $R_i$ is the outcome of the $i$-th rollout and $N$ is the number of simulations.
       
       \item \textbf{Computational Efficiency}: Random rollouts are:
       \begin{itemize}
           \item Fast to execute (no complex evaluation)
           \item Parallelizable (multiple rollouts can run simultaneously)
           \item Scalable to different game complexities
       \end{itemize}
       
       \item \textbf{Unbiased Estimation}: Random rollouts provide unbiased estimates of position values, assuming the default policy (random play) is unbiased. This contrasts with heuristic evaluation functions that may introduce systematic biases.
       
       \item \textbf{Adaptive Evaluation}: The quality of rollout-based evaluation improves automatically as the tree grows, since more promising positions receive more simulations and thus more accurate estimates.
   \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Integration with Neural Networks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{In the context of Neural MCTS (e.g., AlphaGo-style approaches), how are policy networks and value networks incorporated into the search procedure?}
    
    \textbf{Answer:} Neural MCTS integrates deep learning with tree search through two key components:
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Policy Network Integration}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Prior Probabilities}: The policy network outputs prior probabilities $P(a|s)$ for each legal action, replacing uniform random action selection during expansion
            \item \textbf{UCB1 Modification}: The UCB1 formula is modified to incorporate priors:
            \[UCB1(s,a) = Q(s,a) + c \cdot P(a|s) \cdot \frac{\sqrt{N(s)}}{1 + N(s,a)}\]
            \item \textbf{Guided Expansion}: New nodes are expanded with actions weighted by their prior probabilities, focusing search on moves the network considers promising
            \item \textbf{Training Target}: The policy network is trained to predict the visit distribution from MCTS, creating a self-improving loop
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Value Network Integration}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Rollout Replacement}: Instead of random rollouts, the value network provides direct position evaluation $V(s)$
            \item \textbf{Hybrid Evaluation}: Combines MCTS value estimates with neural network predictions:
            \[V_{final}(s) = \lambda \cdot V_{MCTS}(s) + (1-\lambda) \cdot V_{NN}(s)\]
            \item \textbf{Backpropagation Enhancement}: Value network predictions can be used to initialize node values or provide additional training signals
            \item \textbf{Computational Efficiency}: Eliminates the need for expensive random rollouts, significantly speeding up the search
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Training Loop Integration}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Self-Play}: Networks are trained on games played by the current best version of the agent
            \item \textbf{Target Generation}: MCTS provides high-quality targets for both policy and value networks
            \item \textbf{Iterative Improvement}: Each iteration improves both the networks and the search quality
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{What is the role of the policy network's output ("prior probabilities") in the Expansion phase, and how does it influence which moves get explored?}
    
    \textbf{Answer:} Prior probabilities play a crucial role in guiding MCTS exploration:
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Informed Expansion}: Instead of expanding all legal moves uniformly, prior probabilities guide which moves to explore first:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Moves with higher priors are more likely to be expanded early
            \item Moves with very low priors may never be explored if computational budget is limited
            \item This creates a natural pruning mechanism based on neural network confidence
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{UCB1 Enhancement}: The modified UCB1 formula incorporates priors:
        \[UCB1(s,a) = Q(s,a) + c \cdot P(a|s) \cdot \frac{\sqrt{N(s)}}{1 + N(s,a)}\]
        This means:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item High-prior moves get additional exploration bonus
            \item Low-prior moves receive less exploration incentive
            \item The exploration term is proportional to the prior probability
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Search Efficiency}: Prior probabilities dramatically improve search efficiency by:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Focusing computational resources on promising moves
            \item Reducing the branching factor effectively
            \item Enabling deeper search in relevant parts of the tree
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Learning Integration}: The priors create a feedback loop:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item MCTS explores moves suggested by the policy network
            \item Search results inform policy network training
            \item Improved policy network provides better priors for future searches
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Temperature Control}: Prior probabilities can be modified with temperature to control exploration:
        \[P_{temp}(a|s) = \frac{P(a|s)^{1/\tau}}{\sum_{a'} P(a'|s)^{1/\tau}}\]
        where $\tau > 1$ increases exploration and $\tau < 1$ increases exploitation.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Backpropagation and Node Statistics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{During backpropagation, how do we update node visit counts and value estimates?}
    
    \textbf{Answer:} Backpropagation in MCTS updates node statistics along the path taken during selection:
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Visit Count Updates}: For each node $(s,a)$ in the path:
        \[N(s,a) \leftarrow N(s,a) + 1\]
        This incrementally tracks how many times each state-action pair has been visited.
        
        \item \textbf{Value Updates}: The value estimate is updated using incremental averaging:
        \[Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \frac{R - Q(s,a)}{N(s,a)}\]
        where $R$ is the reward from the simulation. This can be rewritten as:
        \[Q(s,a) \leftarrow \frac{(N(s,a) - 1) \cdot Q(s,a) + R}{N(s,a)}\]
        
        \item \textbf{Path Traversal}: The backpropagation follows the exact path taken during selection:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Start from the leaf node where simulation was performed
            \item Move up to the parent node
            \item Update statistics for the action that led to the current node
            \item Continue until reaching the root
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Reward Handling}: The reward $R$ may need to be adjusted based on the player perspective:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item In zero-sum games: alternate the sign of rewards for different players
            \item In cooperative games: use the same reward for all players
            \item In single-agent problems: use the reward as-is
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Incremental Computation}: The update formula ensures that:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item No need to store all previous rewards
            \item Memory-efficient implementation
            \item Numerically stable updates
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{Why is it important to aggregate results carefully (e.g., averaging or summing outcomes) when multiple simulations pass through the same node?}
    
    \textbf{Answer:} Careful aggregation is crucial for accurate value estimation and proper MCTS behavior:
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Statistical Accuracy}: Multiple simulations through the same node provide multiple samples of the true value distribution. Proper aggregation:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Reduces variance in value estimates
            \item Provides more reliable statistics for UCB1 selection
            \item Enables convergence to true expected values
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Incremental Averaging}: The standard update formula:
        \[Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \frac{R - Q(s,a)}{N(s,a)}\]
        is equivalent to computing the sample mean:
        \[Q(s,a) = \frac{1}{N(s,a)} \sum_{i=1}^{N(s,a)} R_i\]
        This ensures that each simulation contributes equally to the final estimate.
        
        \item \textbf{UCB1 Reliability}: The UCB1 formula relies on accurate visit counts and value estimates:
        \[UCB1(s,a) = Q(s,a) + c\sqrt{\frac{\ln N(s)}{N(s,a)}}\]
        Incorrect aggregation would lead to:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Biased value estimates
            \item Incorrect exploration bonuses
            \item Poor action selection
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Convergence Guarantees}: Proper aggregation is necessary for MCTS convergence properties:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Ensures visit counts accurately reflect exploration
            \item Maintains statistical properties required for UCB1
            \item Enables theoretical analysis of MCTS performance
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Handling Different Reward Scales}: Careful aggregation is especially important when:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Rewards have different scales or distributions
            \item Multiple reward sources contribute to a single node
            \item Discount factors are applied to future rewards
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Memory Efficiency}: Incremental updates avoid storing all historical rewards:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Constant memory per node regardless of visit count
            \item Numerically stable for large numbers of visits
            \item Computationally efficient updates
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Hyperparameters and Practical Considerations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{How does the exploration constant (often denoted $c_{puct}$ or $c$) in the UCB formula affect the search behavior, and how would you tune it?}
    
    \textbf{Answer:} The exploration constant $c$ significantly influences MCTS behavior and requires careful tuning:
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Effect on Search Behavior}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{High $c$ values} ($c > \sqrt{2}$):
            \begin{itemize}
                \item More exploratory behavior
                \item Visits more diverse actions
                \item Slower convergence to optimal moves
                \item Better for early game phases or when uncertainty is high
            \end{itemize}
            
            \item \textbf{Low $c$ values} ($c < \sqrt{2}$):
            \begin{itemize}
                \item More exploitative behavior
                \item Focuses on promising moves
                \item Faster convergence to good moves
                \item Better for endgame or when confidence is high
            \end{itemize}
            
            \item \textbf{Theoretical optimum} ($c = \sqrt{2}$):
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Balances exploration and exploitation optimally
                \item Provides logarithmic regret bounds
                \item Good default choice for most applications
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Tuning Strategies}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Game Phase Adaptation}: Use different $c$ values for different game phases:
            \[c_{phase} = \begin{cases}
                c_{high} & \text{if early game} \\
                c_{medium} & \text{if mid game} \\
                c_{low} & \text{if endgame}
            \end{cases}\]
            
            \item \textbf{Simulation Budget Adaptation}: Adjust $c$ based on available computational resources:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Few simulations: higher $c$ for more exploration
                \item Many simulations: lower $c$ for focused search
            \end{itemize}
            
            \item \textbf{Opponent Strength Adaptation}: Modify $c$ based on opponent:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Strong opponent: lower $c$ for conservative play
                \item Weak opponent: higher $c$ for aggressive exploration
            \end{itemize}
            
            \item \textbf{Empirical Tuning}: Test different values and measure:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Win rate against various opponents
                \item Convergence speed
                \item Search tree diversity
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Practical Guidelines}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Start with $c = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414$
            \item For games with high branching factor: increase $c$
            \item For games with low branching factor: decrease $c$
            \item Monitor search statistics to guide tuning decisions
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{In what ways can the "temperature" parameter (if used) shape the final move selection, and why might you lower the temperature as training progresses?}
    
    \textbf{Answer:} Temperature controls the randomness in move selection and plays a crucial role in MCTS training:
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Temperature Effect on Move Selection}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{High Temperature} ($\tau > 1$):
            \begin{itemize}
                \item More uniform move selection
                \item Higher exploration of all moves
                \item Smoother probability distributions
                \item Better for early training phases
            \end{itemize}
            
            \item \textbf{Low Temperature} ($\tau < 1$):
            \begin{itemize}
                \item More peaked move selection
                \item Focus on best moves
                \item Sharper probability distributions
                \item Better for late training phases
            \end{itemize}
            
            \item \textbf{Temperature = 1}: Standard softmax without modification
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Mathematical Formulation}:
        The temperature modifies the visit count distribution:
        \[P(a|s) = \frac{N(s,a)^{1/\tau}}{\sum_{a'} N(s',a')^{1/\tau}}\]
        
        \item \textbf{Why Lower Temperature Over Time}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Training Progression}: As the policy network improves:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Early training: High temperature encourages exploration
                \item Mid training: Medium temperature balances exploration/exploitation
                \item Late training: Low temperature focuses on best moves
            \end{itemize}
            
            \item \textbf{Convergence to Optimal Policy}: Lower temperature helps:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Focus on the best moves identified by MCTS
                \item Reduce noise in policy updates
                \item Stabilize training in later phases
            \end{itemize}
            
            \item \textbf{Self-Play Quality}: In self-play scenarios:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item High temperature early: diverse training data
                \item Low temperature late: high-quality training data
                \item Prevents overfitting to suboptimal strategies
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Practical Temperature Schedules}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Linear Decay}: $\tau(t) = \tau_{max} - \frac{t}{T}(\tau_{max} - \tau_{min})$
            \item \textbf{Exponential Decay}: $\tau(t) = \tau_{max} \cdot \gamma^t$
            \item \textbf{Step Decay}: Reduce temperature at specific milestones
            \item \textbf{Adaptive Decay}: Adjust based on training progress metrics
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Interaction with Other Parameters}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Temperature affects the policy network training targets
            \item Lower temperature requires more accurate value estimates
            \item Temperature schedule should be coordinated with learning rate schedules
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

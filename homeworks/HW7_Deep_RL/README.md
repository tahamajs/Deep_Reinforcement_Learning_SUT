## 📋 Overview

This assignment focuses on theoretical foundations and fundamental concepts of deep reinforcement learning, including function approximation, convergence guarantees, and the challenges that arise when combining deep learning with RL.

## 🚦 Deliverables & Workflow (updated)

- **Notebook stub:** `code/HW7_Notebook.ipynb` — structured (overview → setup/config/seeds → references → run metadata). No execution has been performed; run locally if needed.
- **Run metadata:** when the notebook metadata cell is run, it writes `reports/run_info.json` with seed, device, versions, timestamp, and commit hash.
- **Answers:** authoritative solutions live in `HW7_Complete_Solutions.md` (also referenced via `answers/README.md`).
- **LaTeX report:** `Homework-7-Template/template.tex` now imports the Markdown solutions via the `markdown` package and should be rendered to PDF (e.g., `pdflatex -output-directory ../reports template.tex` from inside `Homework-7-Template`). The intended output path is `reports/Homework-7-Report.pdf`.
- **Seeding/config:** centralized in the first code cell of the notebook (Python, NumPy, Torch, CUDA deterministic flags).
- **Description PDF alignment:** questions reside in `reports/HW7_Questions.pdf`; the Markdown and imported PDF are expected to answer all items.

## 📚 Core Theoretical Concepts

### 1. Function Approximation in RL

**Why Function Approximation?**

- Tabular methods don't scale to large/continuous state spaces
- Need generalization across similar states
- Memory and computational efficiency

**Types:**

#### Linear Function Approximation

```
V̂(s; w) = ∑i wi φi(s) = wᵀφ(s)

where φ(s) is feature vector
```

**Properties:**

- Convergence guarantees for many algorithms
- Limited representational power
- Easy to analyze theoretically

#### Non-Linear (Deep) Function Approximation

```
V̂(s; θ) = fθ(s)  where fθ is neural network
```

**Properties:**

- High representational power
- Can learn features automatically
- Convergence more difficult to guarantee
- Risk of instability

### 2. The Deadly Triad

**Three Conditions that Together Cause Instability:**

1. **Function Approximation**: Using approximators instead of tabular representations
2. **Bootstrapping**: Updating estimates based on other estimates (TD learning)
3. **Off-Policy Learning**: Learning about policy π while following policy μ ≠ π

**Why Deadly:**

- Any two together usually fine
- All three together can cause divergence
- Fundamental challenge in deep RL

**Classic Example: Baird's Counterexample**

```
Q-learning with linear function approximation
+ Off-policy updates
→ Q-values diverge to infinity
```

**Solutions:**

- Remove one element of triad (often off-policy aspect)
- Use special algorithms (e.g., DQN with target networks)
- Gradient TD methods (GTD, TDC)
- Restriction to on-policy learning

### 3. Convergence Conditions

**Robbins-Monro Conditions for Stochastic Approximation:**

For update rule: θt+1 = θt + αt[target - current]

Convergence requires:

```
1. ∑t αt = ∞        (infinite total learning)
2. ∑t αt² < ∞       (decreasing noise contribution)

Example: αt = 1/t satisfies both
```

**Contraction Mapping Theorem:**

- Bellman operators are contractions (in max norm)
- Guarantees unique fixed point (optimal value function)
- Iterative application converges to fixed point

**When RL Algorithms Converge:**

| Algorithm           | Tabular | Linear FA        | Non-Linear FA            |
| ------------------- | ------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Monte Carlo**     | ✅      | ✅               | ✅ (with conditions)     |
| **TD(0) On-Policy** | ✅      | ✅               | ⚠️ (often works)         |
| **Q-Learning**      | ✅      | ❌ (can diverge) | ❌ (needs tricks)        |
| **SARSA**           | ✅      | ✅               | ⚠️ (often works)         |
| **DQN**             | ✅      | ✅               | ✅ (with target network) |

### 4. Challenges in Deep RL

#### a) Non-Stationarity

```
Target for supervised learning: fixed labels
Target for RL: Q(s',a') depends on current network

Result: "chasing a moving target"
```

**Solution:** Target networks (DQN)

#### b) Correlated Samples

```
Sequential data: (st, at, rt, st+1) highly correlated
Neural networks assume i.i.d. data

Result: Overfitting to recent experience
```

**Solution:** Experience replay

#### c) High Variance

```
Policy gradient estimates have high variance
Slows learning, causes instability
```

**Solutions:** Baselines, advantage functions, multiple workers

#### d) Credit Assignment

```
Which action in sequence led to reward?
Long-term dependencies difficult to learn
```

**Solutions:** Value functions, eligibility traces, attention mechanisms

#### e) Catastrophic Forgetting

```
Network forgets how to solve old states
when learning new states
```

**Solutions:** Experience replay, regularization, progressive neural networks

### 5. Key Theorems and Results

**Policy Gradient Theorem:**

```
∇θJ(θ) = 𝔼π[∇θ log πθ(a|s) Qπ(s,a)]
```

**Importance:** Enables policy optimization without knowing dynamics

**Policy Improvement Theorem:**

```
If πθ' ≥ πθ for all states (greedy improvement),
then Vπθ'(s) ≥ Vπθ(s) for all states
```

**Importance:** Guarantees policy iteration converges to optimal policy

**Bellman Optimality Equations:**

```
V*(s) = max[R(s,a) + γ ∑s' P(s'|s,a)V*(s')]
         a

Q*(s,a) = R(s,a) + γ ∑s' P(s'|s,a) max Q*(s',a')
                               a'
```

**Importance:** Characterizes optimal value functions

**Approximation in Value Space:**

```
|| V - V* ||∞ ≤ (2γ/(1-γ)) || V - ΠV* ||∞

where Π is projection operator
```

**Importance:** Bounds suboptimality due to function approximation error

\section{Introduction and Background}

\subsection{Motivation for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning}

Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) addresses fundamental limitations of traditional flat reinforcement learning approaches by introducing temporal abstraction and multi-level decision making. Traditional RL algorithms face significant challenges when dealing with long-horizon tasks, sparse rewards, and complex environments that require structured exploration and skill reuse.

\textbf{Key Challenges in Flat RL:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Credit Assignment Problem:} In long-horizon tasks spanning hundreds or thousands of timesteps, attributing rewards to specific actions becomes increasingly difficult due to temporal distance between actions and outcomes.
    
    \item \textbf{Sparse Reward Environments:} Many real-world tasks provide rewards only upon task completion, making random exploration ineffective and learning extremely sample-inefficient.
    
    \item \textbf{Curse of Dimensionality:} As task complexity increases, the action space grows exponentially, making exploration and learning computationally intractable.
    
    \item \textbf{Lack of Transfer Learning:} Traditional RL agents must relearn similar behaviors from scratch for each new task, lacking the ability to reuse learned skills.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Human-Inspired Hierarchical Planning:}
Consider the task of preparing dinner, which humans naturally decompose into hierarchical subtasks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{High Level:} Plan meal preparation
    \item \textbf{Mid Level:} Shop for ingredients, prepare food, serve meal
    \item \textbf{Low Level:} Navigate to store, select items, chop vegetables, etc.
\end{itemize}

This hierarchical decomposition enables humans to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Plan at multiple temporal scales simultaneously
    \item Reuse learned skills across different contexts
    \item Focus attention on relevant subtasks
    \item Transfer knowledge between similar tasks
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Theoretical Foundations}

\textbf{Formal Definition of Hierarchical RL:}
A hierarchical reinforcement learning problem can be formalized as a collection of Semi-Markov Decision Processes (SMDPs) where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each level operates at different temporal scales
    \item Higher levels select abstract actions (options/skills)
    \item Lower levels execute primitive actions to achieve abstract goals
    \item Temporal abstraction enables efficient planning and learning
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key Benefits of Hierarchical Approaches:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Temporal Abstraction:} Enables planning and learning at multiple time scales, reducing the effective horizon length for each level.
    
    \item \textbf{Skill Reuse:} Learned skills can be composed and reused across different tasks and contexts.
    
    \item \textbf{Structured Exploration:} Hierarchical structure provides guidance for exploration, focusing on relevant state-action regions.
    
    \item \textbf{Transfer Learning:} Skills learned in one domain can be adapted or reused in related domains.
    
    \item \textbf{Compositional Generalization:} Complex behaviors can be constructed by combining simpler learned skills.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Theoretical Framework}

\subsection{Options Framework}

The Options framework provides a formal foundation for temporal abstraction in reinforcement learning. An \textbf{option} $\omega$ is defined as a triple $\omega = (I_\omega, \pi_\omega, \beta_\omega)$ where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $I_\omega \subseteq S$: \textbf{Initiation set} - states where the option can be executed
    \item $\pi_\omega: S \times A \rightarrow [0,1]$: \textbf{Option policy} - maps states to action probabilities
    \item $\beta_\omega: S \rightarrow [0,1]$: \textbf{Termination function} - probability of terminating in each state
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP):}
The options framework transforms the original MDP into an SMDP where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item States remain the same: $S_{SMDP} = S_{MDP}$
    \item Actions are replaced by options: $A_{SMDP} = \Omega$ (set of all options)
    \item Transition probabilities become option-dependent: $P(s'|s,\omega)$
    \item Rewards accumulate over option execution: $R(s,\omega) = \mathbb{E}[\sum_{t=0}^{T-1} \gamma^t r_t | s_0 = s, \omega]$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Option Value Functions:}
The value of an option $\omega$ in state $s$ is defined as:
\[
Q_\Omega(s,\omega) = R(s,\omega) + \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,\omega) \max_{\omega'} Q_\Omega(s',\omega')
\]

\textbf{Intra-Option Learning:}
Unlike traditional Q-learning, intra-option learning allows updating Q-values while an option is being executed:
\[
Q_\Omega(s,\omega) \leftarrow Q_\Omega(s,\omega) + \alpha[r + \gamma^k Q_\Omega(s',\omega') - Q_\Omega(s,\omega)]
\]
where $k$ is the number of steps the option was executed.

\subsection{Feudal Hierarchies}

Feudal hierarchies implement a manager-worker architecture where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Manager:} Sets abstract goals at high temporal resolution
    \item \textbf{Worker:} Executes primitive actions to achieve manager's goals
    \item \textbf{Communication:} Goals are communicated through a shared representation space
\end{itemize}

\textbf{FeudalNet Architecture:}
The FeudalNet implements this hierarchy using:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Perception Module:} Shared state representation $z_t = f(s_t)$
    \item \textbf{Manager Network:} LSTM that outputs goals $g_t$ every $c$ timesteps
    \item \textbf{Worker Network:} LSTM that takes state and goal to output actions
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Training Objectives:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Manager Reward:} Cosine similarity between goal and state transition:
    \[
    r_{manager}(t) = \cos(g_t, z_{t+c} - z_t)
    \]
    \item \textbf{Worker Reward:} Combination of extrinsic and intrinsic rewards:
    \[
    r_{worker}(t) = r_{extrinsic}(t) + \alpha \cos(g_t, z_{t+1} - z_t)
    \]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning}

Goal-conditioned RL extends traditional RL by conditioning policies on goals, enabling:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Universal Policies:} Single policy that can achieve multiple goals
    \item \textbf{Transfer Learning:} Skills learned for one goal can be adapted to others
    \item \textbf{Sparse Reward Handling:} Goals provide dense intrinsic rewards
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Universal Value Function Approximators (UVFA):}
UVFAs extend value functions to be goal-conditioned:
\[
Q(s,a,g) = \mathbb{E}[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t r_t | s_0 = s, a_0 = a, g]
\]

\textbf{Hindsight Experience Replay (HER):}
HER addresses sparse rewards by relabeling failed trajectories with achieved goals:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Future Strategy:} Sample future states as goals
    \item \textbf{Final Strategy:} Use terminal state as goal
    \item \textbf{Random Strategy:} Sample random goals from goal space
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Skill Discovery}

\textbf{Diversity is All You Need (DIAYN):}
DIAYN learns diverse skills without external rewards using information-theoretic objectives:

\textbf{Objective Function:}
\[
\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_{s,a,z}[\log q_\phi(z|s)] - \mathbb{E}_{s,z}[\log p(z)]
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $q_\phi(z|s)$: Discriminator that predicts skill from state
    \item $p(z)$: Prior distribution over skills
    \item $z$: Skill identifier
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Intrinsic Reward:}
The intrinsic reward encourages state-skill predictability:
\[
r_{intrinsic}(s,z) = \log q_\phi(z|s) - \log p(z)
\]

\textbf{Emergent Behaviors:}
DIAYN discovers diverse skills such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Locomotion patterns
    \item Object manipulation behaviors
    \item Navigation strategies
    \item Exploration patterns
\end{itemize}

\section{Part 2 [40-points]}

\subsection{Implementation Analysis}

Based on the provided CQL-SAC implementation in the notebook, we can analyze the key components and their effectiveness:

\subsubsection{Key Implementation Details}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{CQL Regularization in Critic Loss:}
    The implementation includes CQL regularization terms in both critic networks:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Random Actions:} Samples random actions uniformly from the action space to create a baseline
        \item \textbf{Policy Actions:} Uses current and next state policy actions for comparison
        \item \textbf{Log-Sum-Exp:} Computes $\log \sum \exp(Q/\text{temp})$ to penalize high Q-values
        \item \textbf{Temperature Scaling:} Uses temperature parameter to control the sharpness of the penalty
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Conservative Penalty Calculation:}
    \begin{align}
    \text{CQL\_loss} &= \text{cql\_weight} \times \text{temp} \times \log \sum \exp(Q/\text{temp}) - Q_{\text{dataset}}
    \end{align}
    This ensures Q-values for dataset actions are not underestimated while penalizing high Q-values for other actions.
    
    \item \textbf{Double Q-Learning:} Uses two separate critic networks to reduce overestimation bias, taking the minimum of both estimates.
    
    \item \textbf{Soft Actor-Critic Integration:} Combines CQL with SAC's entropy regularization for stable learning.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Training Results Analysis}

From the training output, we observe:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Initial Performance:} Starting reward of -1141.12 shows the agent begins with poor performance
    \item \textbf{Learning Progress:} Gradual improvement from episodes 1-30, with rewards improving from -879 to around -124
    \item \textbf{Convergence Pattern:} The moving average shows steady improvement, indicating effective learning
    \item \textbf{CQL Effectiveness:} The conservative regularization prevents overestimation while allowing learning
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Comparison with Random Policy}

The implementation includes evaluation against a random policy baseline:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Random Baseline:} Provides a lower bound for performance comparison
    \item \textbf{Policy Improvement:} The trained agent significantly outperforms random actions
    \item \textbf{Conservative Learning:} CQL ensures the learned policy is safe and doesn't exploit dataset limitations
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Insights}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{CQL Effectiveness:} The conservative regularization successfully prevents overestimation while maintaining learning capability
    
    \item \textbf{Sample Efficiency:} The combination of offline dataset and limited online interaction provides good sample efficiency
    
    \item \textbf{Stability:} The entropy regularization and double Q-learning contribute to stable training
    
    \item \textbf{Practical Considerations:} The implementation demonstrates how CQL can be integrated with modern RL algorithms like SAC
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Extensions and Improvements}

Potential improvements to the implementation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Adaptive CQL Weight:} Dynamically adjust the CQL penalty strength based on training progress
    \item \textbf{Better Action Sampling:} Use more sophisticated action sampling strategies for the conservative penalty
    \item \textbf{Model Integration:} Incorporate learned environment models for more comprehensive conservative estimation
    \item \textbf{Multi-Task Learning:} Extend to multi-task scenarios with shared conservative regularization
\end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Transfer Learning Capabilities:} We have demonstrated how hierarchical approaches enable effective knowledge transfer between related tasks through skill composition and reuse.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Impact on the Field:}
The insights gained from this work contribute to the broader understanding of how intelligent systems can operate at multiple temporal scales. Hierarchical RL represents a crucial step toward developing AI systems that can:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Handle complex, long-horizon tasks efficiently
    \item Learn reusable skills that generalize across domains
    \item Plan and act at multiple levels of abstraction
    \item Transfer knowledge between related problems
\end{itemize}

The methods explored in this work have immediate applications in:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Robotics:} Manipulation tasks requiring both high-level planning and low-level control
    \item \textbf{Autonomous Systems:} Navigation and decision-making in complex environments
    \item \textbf{Game AI:} Strategic planning combined with tactical execution
    \item \textbf{Resource Management:} Multi-scale optimization problems
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Future Outlook:}
As we look toward the future, hierarchical reinforcement learning will play an increasingly important role in developing more capable and general AI systems. The combination of temporal abstraction, skill discovery, and compositional learning provides a powerful framework for tackling the complex challenges of real-world AI applications.

The continued development of hierarchical RL methods, combined with advances in neural architecture design, meta-learning, and safety-constrained learning, promises to unlock new possibilities for creating AI systems that can operate effectively in the complex, multi-scale world we inhabit.

This work represents not just a technical achievement, but a step toward understanding how intelligence itself might be structured hierarchically, with different levels of abstraction working together to solve problems that would be intractable for any single-level approach.

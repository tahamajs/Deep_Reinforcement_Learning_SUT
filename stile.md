  direction="rtl"
  align="center"
>
  <table style="border-style:hidden;border-collapse:collapse;">
    <tr>
      <td><img width="130" align="right" src="logo1.png" /></td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">
        <h1>Neural Networks and Deep Learning</h1>
        <h2>Student Name - Student ID</h2>
        <h3>University Name<br />Faculty Name</h3>
      </td>
      <td><img width="170" align="left" src="logo2.png" /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
```

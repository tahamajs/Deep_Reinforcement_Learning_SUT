# Amy Zhang

### About

Amy Zhang is an Assistant Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering at UT Austin and a Texas Instruments/Kilby Fellow, studying reinforcement learning with an emphasis on sample efficiency, generalization, and state abstraction in both simulation and real-world robotics. Her work bridges theory and practice to develop robust RL algorithms for sequential decision-making; she also leads UT’s MIDI lab and recently secured an Army Research Office award for integrating combinatorial generalization with RL methods.

# Anne Collins

### About

Anne G. E. Collins is an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology at UC Berkeley and a faculty member in the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, where she leads the Computational Cognitive Neuroscience (CCN) Lab. Her research develops and tests computational models of human learning, decision-making, and executive functions—especially how reinforcement learning, working memory, and neural signals interact—to understand flexible, adaptive cognition. Using behavioral experiments, EEG, imaging, and sophisticated modeling (e.g., Bayesian inference, neural networks), her work has revealed how fast working memory systems can interfere with slower but more durable reinforcement learning, with implications for AI and psychiatry.

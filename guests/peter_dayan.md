### About

Peter Dayan is a Director at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tübingen and a leading figure in theoretical neuroscience and artificial intelligence. He studied mathematics at Cambridge University and earned his Ph.D. from the University of Edinburgh, followed by postdoctoral work at the Salk Institute and the University of Toronto. After serving as an assistant professor at MIT, he co-founded the renowned Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit in London and led it as Director from 2002 to 2017. His research explores decision-making in the brain, the roles of neuromodulators, and computational models of psychiatric disorders, placing him at the intersection of neuroscience and AI. Dayan has received numerous accolades, including the Rumelhart Prize, the Brain Prize, and Germany’s prestigious Alexander von Humboldt Professorship. He is a Fellow of both the Royal Society and the AAAS, and continues to shape our understanding of how brains and machines learn and make decisions.

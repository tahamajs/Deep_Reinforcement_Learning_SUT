# Martha White

### About

Martha White is an Associate Professor of Computing Science at the University of Alberta, a Canada CIFAR AI Chair, and a Fellow at Amii, where she leads research on adaptive reinforcement learning agents capable of continual learning in real-world environments. Her work focuses on representation learning—employing sparse and recurrent neural architectures—and off-policy methods that allow agents to learn from streams of data, supporting applications such as control of industrial processes like water treatment systems. She also plays a key role in co-founding RL CORE with Adam White, has delivered invited talks at top venues like ICLR, ICML, and NeurIPS, and has earned notable distinctions including IEEE’s “AI’s 10 to Watch” award.

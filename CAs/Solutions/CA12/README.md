# Computer Assignment 12: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and Advanced Policy Methods

## Abstract

This assignment presents a comprehensive study of multi-agent reinforcement learning and advanced policy methods, exploring the challenges and solutions for learning in multi-agent environments with both cooperative and competitive settings. We implement and analyze various multi-agent algorithms including Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC), Value Decomposition Networks (VDN), Counterfactual Multi-Agent Policy Gradients (COMA), and advanced policy optimization methods. The assignment covers game theory foundations, centralized training decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigms, and distributed training approaches. Through systematic experimentation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of different multi-agent learning strategies and their applications to complex multi-agent scenarios.

**Keywords:** Multi-agent reinforcement learning, game theory, cooperative learning, competitive learning, MAAC, VDN, COMA, MADDPG, distributed training, policy optimization

## 1. Introduction

Multi-agent reinforcement learning represents a significant extension of single-agent reinforcement learning, where multiple agents interact in a shared environment and must learn to coordinate, compete, or coexist effectively [1]. Unlike single-agent settings, multi-agent environments introduce additional challenges such as non-stationarity, partial observability, and the need for coordination mechanisms. These challenges have led to the development of specialized algorithms and training paradigms that address the unique aspects of multi-agent learning.

### 1.1 Learning Objectives

By the end of this assignment, you will understand:

1. **Multi-Agent RL Foundations**:

   - Game theory basics (Nash equilibrium, Pareto optimality)
   - Cooperative vs competitive multi-agent settings
   - Non-stationarity and partial observability challenges
   - Centralized training decentralized execution (CTDE)

2. **Cooperative Multi-Agent Learning**:

   - Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods
   - Value Decomposition Networks (VDN)
   - Counterfactual Multi-Agent Policy Gradients (COMA)
   - Credit assignment and reward shaping

3. **Advanced Policy Gradient Methods**:

   - Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) variants
   - Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
   - Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) extensions
   - Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)

4. **Distributed Reinforcement Learning**:
   - Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C)
   - IMPALA architecture and V-trace
   - Parameter server architectures
   - Evolutionary strategies for RL

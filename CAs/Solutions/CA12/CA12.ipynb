    "### Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning extends single-agent RL to environments with multiple learning agents. Key challenges include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-stationarity**: The environment appears non-stationary from each agent's perspective as other agents learn\n",
    "2. **Partial observability**: Agents may have limited information about others' actions and observations\n",
    "3. **Credit assignment**: Determining individual contributions to team rewards\n",
    "4. **Scalability**: Computational complexity grows exponentially with number of agents\n",
    "5. **Equilibrium concepts**: Finding stable solutions in multi-agent settings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game-Theoretic Foundations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nash Equilibrium**: A strategy profile where no agent can improve by unilaterally changing strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For agents $i = 1, ..., n$ with strategy spaces $S_i$ and utility functions $u_i(s_1, ..., s_n)$:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Pareto Optimality**: A strategy profile is Pareto optimal if no other profile improves at least one agent's utility without decreasing another's.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stackelberg Equilibrium**: Leader-follower game structure where one agent commits to a strategy first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MARL Paradigms\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Independent Learning**: Each agent treats others as part of the environment\n",

    "1. **Direct Communication**: Explicit message passing between agents\n",
    "2. **Emergent Communication**: Learned communication protocols through RL\n",
    "3. **Indirect Communication**: Environment-mediated information sharing\n",

    "For agent $i$ sending message $m_i^t$ at time $t$:\n",

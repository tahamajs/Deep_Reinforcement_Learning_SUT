    "## 1.1 Theoretical Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning extends single-agent RL to environments with multiple learning agents. Key challenges include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-stationarity**: The environment appears non-stationary from each agent's perspective as other agents learn\n",
    "2. **Partial observability**: Agents may have limited information about others' actions and observations\n",
    "3. **Credit assignment**: Determining individual contributions to team rewards\n",
    "4. **Scalability**: Computational complexity grows exponentially with number of agents\n",
    "5. **Equilibrium concepts**: Finding stable solutions in multi-agent settings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game-Theoretic Foundations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nash Equilibrium**: A strategy profile where no agent can improve by unilaterally changing strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For agents $i = 1, ..., n$ with strategy spaces $S_i$ and utility functions $u_i(s_1, ..., s_n)$:\n",
    "$$s^* = (s_1^*, ..., s_n^*) \\text{ is a Nash equilibrium if } \\forall i, s_i: u_i(s_i^*, s_{-i}^*) \\geq u_i(s_i, s_{-i}^*)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pareto Optimality**: A strategy profile is Pareto optimal if no other profile improves at least one agent's utility without decreasing another's.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stackelberg Equilibrium**: Leader-follower game structure where one agent commits to a strategy first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MARL Paradigms\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Independent Learning**: Each agent treats others as part of the environment\n",
    "2. **Joint Action Learning**: Agents learn about others' actions and adapt accordingly  \n",
    "3. **Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC)**: Centralized training with decentralized execution\n",
    "4. **Communication-Based Learning**: Agents exchange information to coordinate\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cooperation vs Competition Spectrum\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fully Cooperative**: Shared reward, common goal (e.g., team sports)\n",
    "- **Fully Competitive**: Zero-sum game (e.g., adversarial settings)\n",
    "- **Mixed-Motive**: Partially cooperative and competitive (e.g., resource sharing)\n",

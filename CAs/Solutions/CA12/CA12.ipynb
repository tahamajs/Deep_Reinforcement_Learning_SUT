    "# Computer Assignment 12: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and Advanced Policy Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment presents a comprehensive study of multi-agent reinforcement learning and advanced policy methods, exploring the challenges and solutions for learning in multi-agent environments with both cooperative and competitive settings. We implement and analyze various multi-agent algorithms including Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC), Value Decomposition Networks (VDN), Counterfactual Multi-Agent Policy Gradients (COMA), and advanced policy optimization methods. The assignment covers game theory foundations, centralized training decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigms, and distributed training approaches. Through systematic experimentation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of different multi-agent learning strategies and their applications to complex multi-agent scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keywords:** Multi-agent reinforcement learning, game theory, cooperative learning, competitive learning, MAAC, VDN, COMA, MADDPG, distributed training, policy optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-agent reinforcement learning represents a significant extension of single-agent reinforcement learning, where multiple agents interact in a shared environment and must learn to coordinate, compete, or coexist effectively [1]. Unlike single-agent settings, multi-agent environments introduce additional challenges such as non-stationarity, partial observability, and the need for coordination mechanisms. These challenges have led to the development of specialized algorithms and training paradigms that address the unique aspects of multi-agent learning.\n",

    "### Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (marl)\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning extends single-agent RL to environments with multiple learning agents. Key challenges include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-stationarity**: The environment appears non-stationary from each agent's perspective as other agents learn\n",
    "2. **Partial observability**: Agents may have limited information about others' actions and observations\n",
    "3. **Credit assignment**: Determining individual contributions to team rewards\n",
    "4. **Scalability**: Computational complexity grows exponentially with number of agents\n",
    "5. **Equilibrium concepts**: Finding stable solutions in multi-agent settings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game-theoretic Foundations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nash Equilibrium**: A strategy profile where no agent can improve by unilaterally changing strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For agents $i = 1, ..., n$ with strategy spaces $S*i$ and utility functions $u*i(s*1, ..., s*n)$:\n",
    "$$s^* = (s*1^*, ..., s*n^*) \\text{ is a Nash equilibrium if } \\forall i, s*i: u*i(s*i^*, s*{-i}^*) \\geq u*i(s*i, s_{-i}^*)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pareto Optimality**: A strategy profile is Pareto optimal if no other profile improves at least one agent's utility without decreasing another's.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stackelberg Equilibrium**: Leader-follower game structure where one agent commits to a strategy first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Marl Paradigms\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Independent Learning**: Each agent treats others as part of the environment\n",

# Section 1: Model-based Reinforcement Learning

Model-Based RL learns an explicit model of the environment dynamics and uses it for planning and control.

## 1.1 Theoretical Foundation

### Environment Dynamics Model
The goal is to learn a transition model $p(s*{t+1}, r*t | s*t, a*t)$ that predicts next states and rewards.

**Key Components:**
- **Deterministic Model**: $s*{t+1} = f(s*t, a_t) + \epsilon$
- **Stochastic Model**: $s*{t+1} \sim p(\cdot | s*t, a_t)$
- **Ensemble Methods**: Multiple models to capture uncertainty

### Model-predictive Control (mpc)
Uses the learned model to plan actions by optimizing over a finite horizon:

$$a^**t = \arg\max*{a*t, \ldots, a*{t+H-1}} \sum*{k=0}^{H-1} \gamma^k r*{t+k}$$

where states are predicted using the learned model.

### Dyna-q Algorithm
Combines model-free and model-based learning:
1. **Direct RL**: Update Q-function from real experience
2. **Planning**: Use model to generate simulated experience
3. **Model Learning**: Update dynamics model from real data

### Advantages and Challenges
**Advantages:**
- Sample efficiency through planning
- Can handle sparse rewards
- Enables what-if analysis

**Challenges:**
- Model bias and compounding errors
- Computational complexity
- Partial observability

# Section 2: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning

Hierarchical RL decomposes complex tasks into simpler subtasks through temporal and spatial abstraction.

## 2.1 Theoretical Foundation

### Options Framework
An **option** is a closed-loop policy for taking actions over a period of time. Formally, an option consists of:
- **Initiation set** $I$: States where the option can be initiated
- **Policy** $\pi$: Action selection within the option
- **Termination condition** $\beta$: Probability of terminating the option

### Semi-markov Decision Process (smdp)
Options extend MDPs to SMDPs where:
- Actions can take variable amounts of time
- Temporal abstraction enables hierarchical planning
- Q-learning over options: $Q(s,o) = r + \gamma^k Q(s', o')$

### Goal-conditioned Rl
Learn policies conditioned on goals: $\pi(a|s,g)$
- **Hindsight Experience Replay (HER)**: Learn from failed attempts
- **Universal Value Function**: $V(s,g)$ for any goal $g$
- **Intrinsic Motivation**: Generate own goals for exploration

### Hierarchical Actor-critic (hac)
Multi-level hierarchy where:
- **High-level policy**: Selects subgoals
- **Low-level policy**: Executes actions to reach subgoals
- **Temporal abstraction**: Different time scales at each level

### Feudal Networks
Hierarchical architecture with:
- **Manager**: Sets goals for workers
- **Worker**: Executes actions to achieve goals
- **Feudal objective**: Manager maximizes reward, Worker maximizes goal achievement

## 2.2 Key Advantages

**Sample Efficiency:**
- Reuse learned skills across tasks
- Faster learning through temporal abstraction

**Interpretability:**
- Hierarchical structure mirrors human thinking
- Decomposable and explainable decisions

**Transfer Learning:**
- Skills transfer across related environments
- Compositional generalization

      • HierarchicalRLEnvironment: Custom test environment


# Section 3: Advanced Planning and Control

Advanced planning algorithms combine learned models with sophisticated search techniques.

## 3.1 Monte Carlo Tree Search (mcts)

MCTS is a best-first search algorithm that uses Monte Carlo simulations for decision making.

### Mcts Algorithm Steps:
1. **Selection**: Navigate down the tree using UCB1 formula
2. **Expansion**: Add new child nodes to the tree
3. **Simulation**: Run random rollouts from leaf nodes
4. **Backpropagation**: Update node values with simulation results

### Ucb1 Selection Formula:
$$UCB1(s,a) = Q(s,a) + c \sqrt{\frac{\ln N(s)}{N(s,a)}}$$

Where:
- $Q(s,a)$: Average reward for action $a$ in state $s$
- $N(s)$: Visit count for state $s$
- $N(s,a)$: Visit count for action $a$ in state $s$
- $c$: Exploration constant

### Alphazero Integration
Combines MCTS with neural networks:
- **Policy Network**: $p(a|s)$ guides selection
- **Value Network**: $v(s)$ estimates leaf values
- **Self-Play**: Generates training data through MCTS games

## 3.2 Model-based Value Expansion (mve)

Uses learned models to expand value function estimates:

$$V*{MVE}(s) = \max*a \left[ r(s,a) + \gamma \sum_{s'} p(s'|s,a) V(s') \right]$$

### Trajectory Optimization
- **Cross-Entropy Method (CEM)**: Iterative sampling and fitting
- **Random Shooting**: Sample multiple action sequences
- **Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)**: Information-theoretic approach

## 3.3 Latent Space Planning

Planning in learned latent representations:

### World Models Architecture:
1. **Vision Model (V)**: Encodes observations to latent states
2. **Memory Model (M)**: Predicts next latent states  
3. **Controller Model (C)**: Maps latent states to actions

### Planet Algorithm:
- **Recurrent State Space Model (RSSM)**:
- Deterministic path: $h*t = f(h*{t-1}, a_{t-1})$
- Stochastic path: $s*t \sim p(s*t | h_t)$
- **Planning**: Cross-entropy method in latent space
- **Learning**: Variational inference for world model

## 3.4 Challenges and Solutions

### Model Bias
- **Problem**: Learned models have prediction errors
- **Solutions**: 
- Model ensembles for uncertainty quantification
- Conservative planning with uncertainty penalties
- Robust optimization techniques

### Computational Complexity
- **Problem**: Planning is computationally expensive
- **Solutions**:
- Hierarchical planning with multiple time scales
- Approximate planning with limited horizons
- Parallel Monte Carlo simulations

### Exploration Vs Exploitation
- **Problem**: Balancing exploration and exploitation in planning
- **Solutions**:
- UCB-based selection in MCTS
- Optimistic initialization
- Information-gain based rewards

    "*This assignment explores advanced deep reinforcement learning paradigms that address fundamental limitations of traditional model-free methods. We investigate model-based reinforcement learning techniques that learn explicit environment dynamics for sample-efficient planning, and hierarchical reinforcement learning approaches that decompose complex tasks through temporal abstraction. The integration of these methodologies with sophisticated planning algorithms—including Monte Carlo Tree Search, model-based value expansion, and latent space planning—enables effective learning in high-dimensional, long-horizon tasks. Through comprehensive experiments and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate significant improvements in sample efficiency, transfer learning capability, and interpretability compared to conventional deep RL approaches.*\n",

    "#### When to Use Model-Based RL:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Use when:**\n",
    "- Sample efficiency is critical (expensive real-world interaction)\n",
    "- Environment dynamics are relatively smooth\n",
    "- Planning horizon is short-to-medium (≤20 steps)\n",
    "- Simulator available for validation\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Avoid when:**\n",
    "- Asymptotic performance is paramount\n",
    "- Environment is highly stochastic\n",
    "- Real-time constraints prohibit planning\n",
    "- State space is extremely high-dimensional\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Use Hierarchical RL:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Use when:**\n",
    "- Tasks have natural temporal structure\n",
    "- Multiple related tasks or goals\n",
    "- Long-horizon decision making required\n",
    "- Transfer learning is important\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Avoid when:**\n",
    "- Tasks are inherently flat\n",
    "- Single-goal, short-horizon problems\n",
    "- Training time is severely constrained\n",
    "- Interpretability not valued\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Planning Algorithm Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Random Shooting:** Baseline, continuous actions\n",
    "- **CEM (MPC):** Continuous actions, moderate horizon\n",
    "- **MCTS:** Discrete actions, deep planning needed\n",
    "- **MVE:** Best balance, hybrid approach\n",
    "- **Latent Planning:** High-dimensional observations (images)"

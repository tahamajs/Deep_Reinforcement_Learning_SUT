# Section 1: Theoretical Foundations of Model-based Reinforcement Learning

## 1.1 from Model-free to Model-based Learning

In our journey through reinforcement learning, we have primarily focused on **model-free methods** such as Q-learning, SARSA, and policy gradient methods. These methods learn directly from experience without explicitly modeling the environment. However, there are fundamental advantages to learning and using environment models:

### Model-free Vs Model-based Comparison

| Aspect | Model-Free Methods | Model-Based Methods |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------|
| **Learning** | Learn value functions or policies directly | Learn environment model first |
| **Sample Efficiency** | Generally less sample efficient | Generally more sample efficient |
| **Computational Cost** | Lower per-step computation | Higher per-step computation |
| **Planning** | No explicit planning | Can plan with learned model |
| **Robustness** | More robust to model errors | Sensitive to model inaccuracies |
| **Interpretability** | Less interpretable | More interpretable (explicit model) |

## 1.2 the Model-based Rl Framework

The general model-based RL framework consists of three main components:

1. **Model Learning**: Learn a model of the environment from experience
   $$\hat{P}(s'|s,a) \approx P(s'|s,a)$$
   $$\hat{R}(s,a) \approx E[R|s,a]$$

2. **Planning**: Use the learned model to compute optimal policies
- Value iteration with learned model
- Policy iteration with learned model  
- Monte Carlo Tree Search
- Model Predictive Control

3. **Acting**: Execute actions in the real environment
- Collect new experience
- Update the model
- Replan with improved model

## 1.3 Advantages of Model-based Methods

**Sample Efficiency**: 
- Can generate synthetic experience using the learned model
- Each real experience can be used multiple times for planning
- Particularly important in expensive real-world applications

**Transfer Learning**:
- Models can transfer across different tasks in the same environment
- Learned dynamics are often more general than policies

**Interpretability and Safety**:
- Explicit models provide insight into system behavior
- Can simulate outcomes before taking actions
- Enable safety verification and constraint checking

**Planning Capabilities**:
- Can look ahead and plan optimal sequences of actions
- Adapt quickly to changes in rewards or goals
- Enable hierarchical and long-term planning

## 1.4 Challenges in Model-based Rl

**Model Bias and Compounding Errors**:
- Errors in the learned model can compound over time
- Model bias can lead to suboptimal policies
- Challenge: Learning accurate models in complex environments

**Computational Complexity**:
- Planning with models can be computationally expensive
- Trade-off between planning depth and computational cost

**Partial Observability**:
- Real environments often have hidden state
- Challenge: Learning models from partial observations

**Stochastic Environments**:
- Need to model uncertainty in transitions and rewards
- Balance between model complexity and accuracy

    📊 Next: Environment model learning and representation


# Section 2: Environment Models and Model Learning

## 2.1 Types of Environment Models

Environment models can be categorized along several dimensions:

### By Representation Type:

**Tabular Models**:
- Store explicit transition probabilities: $P(s'|s,a)$
- Store explicit rewards: $R(s,a)$
- Suitable for small, discrete state-action spaces
- Example: Storing counts and computing maximum likelihood estimates

**Function Approximation Models**:
- Use neural networks to approximate dynamics
- $s' = f_\theta(s,a) + \epsilon$ (deterministic + noise)
- $P(s'|s,a) = \pi_\theta(s'|s,a)$ (stochastic)
- Suitable for large, continuous state-action spaces

### By Uncertainty Representation:

**Deterministic Models**:
- Predict single next state: $s' = f(s,a)$
- Simple but ignores environment stochasticity
- Can add noise independently

**Stochastic Models**:
- Predict distribution over next states: $P(s'|s,a)$
- More accurate for stochastic environments
- Can be parametric (Gaussian) or non-parametric

**Ensemble Models**:
- Multiple models trained on different data subsets
- Uncertainty estimated from ensemble disagreement
- More robust and better uncertainty quantification

## 2.2 Model Learning Approaches

### Maximum Likelihood Estimation (mle)

For tabular environments, we can use simple counting:
$$\hat{P}(s'|s,a) = \frac{N(s,a,s')}{N(s,a)}$$
$$\hat{R}(s,a) = \frac{1}{N(s,a)} \sum*{i} R*i(s,a)$$

### Neural Network Models

For complex environments, use neural networks:
- **Forward Model**: $(s,a) \rightarrow (s', r)$
- **Inverse Model**: $(s,s') \rightarrow a$
- **Combined**: Learn both forward and inverse models jointly

### Training Objectives

**Deterministic Dynamics**:
$$L = \mathbb{E}*{(s,a,s',r) \sim D}[||s' - f*\theta(s,a)||^2 + ||r - g_\theta(s,a)||^2]$$

**Stochastic Dynamics**:
$$L = -\mathbb{E}*{(s,a,s',r) \sim D}[\log P*\theta(s'|s,a) + \log P_\theta(r|s,a)]$$

## 2.3 Model Validation and Selection

### Validation Strategies

**Hold-out Validation**:
- Split data into training and validation sets
- Evaluate model accuracy on unseen transitions
- Risk: May not reflect planning performance

**Cross-Validation**:
- Multiple train/validation splits
- More robust estimate of model quality
- Higher computational cost

**Policy-Aware Validation**:
- Evaluate model on states visited by current policy
- More relevant for planning performance
- Adapts as policy changes

### Model Selection Criteria

**Prediction Accuracy**:
- Mean squared error for continuous states
- Cross-entropy for discrete states
- May not correlate with planning performance

**Planning Performance**:
- Evaluate policies learned with the model
- More relevant but computationally expensive
- Gold standard when feasible

**Uncertainty Calibration**:
- Ensure predicted uncertainty matches actual errors
- Important for robust planning
- Use reliability diagrams and calibration error

# Section 3: Classical Planning with Learned Models

## 3.1 Dynamic Programming with Learned Models

Once we have learned an environment model, we can use classical dynamic programming algorithms to compute optimal policies. This is one of the most straightforward applications of model-based RL.

### Value Iteration with Learned Models

The Value Iteration algorithm can be applied directly using our learned transition probabilities and rewards:

$$V*{k+1}(s) = \max*a \sum*{s'} \hat{P}(s'|s,a)[\hat{R}(s,a,s') + \gamma V*k(s')]$$

**Key Advantages:**
- Guaranteed convergence to optimal policy (if model is accurate)
- Can compute policy for all states simultaneously
- No need for exploration during planning phase

**Potential Issues:**
- Model errors compound over planning horizon
- Assumes learned model is accurate
- May overfit to limited experience

### Policy Iteration with Learned Models

Policy Iteration alternates between policy evaluation and policy improvement using the learned model:

**Policy Evaluation:**
$$V^\pi(s) = \sum_{s'} \hat{P}(s'|s,\pi(s))[\hat{R}(s,\pi(s),s') + \gamma V^\pi(s')]$$

**Policy Improvement:**
$$\pi'(s) = \arg\max*a \sum*{s'} \hat{P}(s'|s,a)[\hat{R}(s,a,s') + \gamma V^\pi(s')]$$

## 3.2 Handling Model Uncertainty

Real learned models have uncertainty. Several approaches address this:

### Pessimistic Planning
- Use lower confidence bounds for model predictions
- $\hat{P}_{pessimistic}(s'|s,a) = \hat{P}(s'|s,a) - \beta \sigma(s'|s,a)$
- Leads to more robust but potentially conservative policies

### Optimistic Planning
- Use upper confidence bounds for model predictions
- Encourages exploration of uncertain regions
- Can lead to more aggressive exploration policies

### Robust Planning
- Optimize for worst-case model within confidence region
- $\max*\pi \min*{M \in \mathcal{U}} V^\pi_M$
- Very conservative but safe approach

## 3.3 Model-based Policy Search

Instead of computing value functions, we can directly search in policy space using the learned model:

### Gradient-based Policy Search
- Use model to compute policy gradients
- $\nabla*\theta J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}*{\tau \sim \pi*\theta, M}[\sum*t \nabla*\theta \log \pi*\theta(a*t|s*t) R(\tau)]$
- Generate synthetic rollouts with learned model

### Evolutionary Policy Search
- Maintain population of policy parameters
- Evaluate policies using learned model
- Select and mutate best policies

### Random Shooting
- Sample random action sequences
- Evaluate using learned model
- Select best sequence and execute first action

# Section 5: Monte Carlo Tree Search (mcts)

Monte Carlo Tree Search is a powerful planning algorithm that has achieved remarkable success in games like Go and has been extended to general reinforcement learning problems.

## 5.1 Theoretical Foundation

MCTS combines:
- **Tree Search**: Systematic exploration of possible future states
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Random rollouts to estimate value
- **Multi-Armed Bandit**: UCB for action selection in tree nodes

### Key Components:

1. **Selection**: Navigate from root to leaf using bandit strategy
2. **Expansion**: Add one or more child nodes
3. **Simulation**: Random rollout from new node
4. **Backpropagation**: Update all nodes on path with result

### Ucb1 Formula for Node Selection:

$$UCB1(i) = \overline{X*i} + C\sqrt{\frac{\ln n}{n*i}}$$

Where:
- $\overline{X_i}$ = average reward of action i
- $n_i$ = number of times action i was selected
- $n$ = total number of selections
- $C$ = exploration parameter

### Mcts in Model-based Rl:

MCTS can be used with learned models to perform sophisticated planning by building search trees that explore promising action sequences.

    IndexError: only integers, slices (`:`), ellipsis (`...`), numpy.newaxis (`None`) and integer or boolean arrays are valid indices


# Section 6: Model Predictive Control (mpc)

Model Predictive Control is a control strategy that uses a model to predict future behavior and optimizes a sequence of control actions over a finite horizon.

## 6.1 Theoretical Foundation

MPC operates on the principle of **receding horizon control**:

1. **Prediction**: Use model to predict future states over horizon H
2. **Optimization**: Solve optimal control problem over this horizon
3. **Execution**: Apply only the first control action
4. **Recede**: Shift horizon forward and repeat

### Key Components:

- **Prediction Model**: $\hat{s}*{t+1} = f(s*t, a_t)$
- **Cost Function**: $J = \sum*{k=0}^{H-1} c(s*{t+k}, a*{t+k}) + V*f(s_{t+H})$
- **Constraints**: State and action constraints
- **Terminal Cost**: $V*f(s*{t+H})$ (optional)

### Advantages:
- Handles constraints naturally
- Provides explicit planning horizon
- Can incorporate uncertainty
- Works with nonlinear models

### Mpc in Rl Context:
- Use learned dynamics models
- Optimize with gradient-based or sampling methods
- Can incorporate learned value functions as terminal costs


```python
demonstrate_mpc()
```

# Section 7: Advanced Model-based Methods and Modern Approaches

## 7.1 Modern Neural Model-based Methods

### Model-based Meta-learning
- **MAML for Model Learning**: Learning models that can quickly adapt to new environments
- **Gradient-Based Meta-Learning**: Using gradients to update model parameters efficiently

### Uncertainty-aware Models
- **Bayesian Neural Networks**: Capturing epistemic uncertainty in dynamics
- **Ensemble Methods**: Multiple models for uncertainty quantification
- **Dropout-Based Uncertainty**: Using Monte Carlo dropout for uncertainty estimation

### Advanced Planning Methods
- **Differentiable Planning**: End-to-end training of planning modules
- **Learned Optimizers**: Using neural networks as optimizers for planning
- **Hierarchical Planning**: Multi-level planning for complex tasks

## 7.2 State-of-the-art Methods

### Model-based Policy Optimization (mbpo)
- Combines model-based and model-free learning
- Uses learned models to generate synthetic data
- Applies model-free algorithms to mixed real and synthetic data

### Dreamer and Dreamerv2
- World models with latent state representations
- Planning in latent space

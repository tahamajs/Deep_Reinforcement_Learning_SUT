# CA2 Notebook Improvements Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ IEEE Formatting Applied
- Added formal Abstract section
- Restructured sections with proper IEEE numbering (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Added formal Definitions, Theorems, and Observations
- Included IEEE-style References section with proper citations
- Used consistent mathematical notation throughout

### 2. ✅ Modular Imports
- All code now imports from Python modules instead of duplicating code
- Clean separation of concerns:
  - `environments/environments.py` - Environment definitions
  - `agents/policies.py` - Policy classes
  - `agents/algorithms.py` - Core RL algorithms
  - `utils/visualization.py` - Visualization functions
  - `experiments/experiments.py` - Experiment frameworks
- Fixed all import errors for proper module resolution

### 3. ✅ Table of Contents Added
- Comprehensive TOC with links to all sections and subsections
- Easy navigation through the notebook
- Follows the notebook structure precisely

### 4. ✅ Enhanced Content
- Better structured markdown sections
- More professional academic writing
- Clear algorithm descriptions with pseudocode
- Improved code comments and explanations
- Better print statements with more informative output

### 5. ✅ Code Quality
- All imports verified and working
- Modules tested successfully
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Reproducible results with fixed random seeds

# Section 1: World Models and Imagination-Augmented Agents

World models represent one of the most promising directions in deep RL, enabling agents to learn internal representations of their environment and use these models for planning and imagination-based learning.

## 1.1 Theoretical Foundations

### The World Model Paradigm

Traditional model-free RL learns policies directly from interactions with the environment. **World Models** take a different approach by first learning a model of the environment, then using this model for:

- **Planning**: Computing optimal actions through forward simulation
- **Data Augmentation**: Generating synthetic experience for training
- **Imagination**: Exploring hypothetical scenarios before acting
- **Transfer Learning**: Applying learned world knowledge to new tasks

### Mathematical Framework

A world model consists of several components:

**Environment Dynamics Model**:
$$s_{t+1} = f_\theta(s_t, a_t) + \epsilon_t$$

Where $f_\theta$ is the learned transition function and $\epsilon_t$ represents model uncertainty.

**Observation Model**:
$$o_t = h_\phi(s_t) + \eta_t$$

Where $h_\phi$ maps hidden states to observations.

**Reward Model**:
$$r_t = g_\psi(s_t, a_t) + \delta_t$$

Where $g_\psi$ predicts immediate rewards.

### Model-Based RL Objectives

**Joint Training Objective**:
$$\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{dynamics}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{reward}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{policy}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{value}}$$

**Dynamics Loss**:
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{dynamics}} = \mathbb{E}[(s_{t+1} - f_\theta(s_t, a_t))^2]$$

**Model Predictive Control (MPC)**:
$$a_t^* = \arg\max_{a_t} \sum_{k=0}^{H} \gamma^k r_{t+k}^{\text{predicted}}$$

Where $H$ is the planning horizon and rewards are predicted using the world model.

### Latent Space Dynamics

Many world models operate in learned latent spaces rather than raw observations:

**Encoder**: $z_t = \text{Encode}(o_t)$
**Dynamics**: $z_{t+1} = f_\theta(z_t, a_t)$  
**Decoder**: $\hat{o}_t = \text{Decode}(z_t)$

**Variational World Models**:
$$q_\phi(z_t|o_{\leq t}, a_{<t}) = \mathcal{N}(\mu_t, \sigma_t^2)$$

**Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)**:
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{ELBO}} = \mathbb{E}[\log p(o_t|z_t)] - \text{KL}[q(z_t|o_{\leq t}) || p(z_t|z_{t-1}, a_{t-1})]$$

## 1.2 Imagination-Augmented Agents

### The I2A Architecture

# Section 2: Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) extends RL to environments with multiple learning agents, introducing challenges of coordination, competition, and emergent behaviors.

## 2.1 Theoretical Foundations

### Multi-Agent System Formulation

**Stochastic Game (Markov Game)**:
A multi-agent extension of MDPs defined by:
- **State Space**: $S$ (shared by all agents)
- **Action Spaces**: $A^i$ for each agent $i$
- **Joint Action Space**: $A = A^1 \times A^2 \times \cdots \times A^n$
- **Transition Function**: $P(s'|s, a^1, \ldots, a^n)$
- **Reward Functions**: $R^i(s, a^1, \ldots, a^n)$ for each agent $i$

**Partial Observability**: Each agent $i$ observes $o^i = O^i(s, a)$ instead of full state $s$.

**Joint Policy**: $\pi = (\pi^1, \pi^2, \ldots, \pi^n)$ where $\pi^i$ is agent $i$'s policy.

**Nash Equilibrium**: A joint policy $\pi^* = (\pi^{1*}, \pi^{2*}, \ldots, \pi^{n*})$ where:
$$J^i(\pi^{i*}, \pi^{-i*}) \geq J^i(\pi^i, \pi^{-i*}) \quad \forall i, \forall \pi^i$$

### Game-Theoretic Concepts

**Cooperative vs. Competitive Settings**:
- **Cooperative**: Agents share common objectives
- **Competitive**: Agents have conflicting objectives  
- **Mixed-Motive**: Combination of cooperation and competition

**Solution Concepts**:
- **Nash Equilibrium**: No agent benefits from unilateral deviation
- **Correlated Equilibrium**: Agents follow recommendations from mediator
- **Stackelberg Equilibrium**: Leader-follower hierarchy
- **Pareto Efficiency**: No improvement possible without hurting someone

### Learning Dynamics

**Multi-Agent Learning Objectives**:

**Independent Learning**: Each agent treats others as part of environment
$$\pi^{i*} = \arg\max_{\pi^i} J^i(\pi^i | \pi^{-i})$$

**Joint Action Learning**: Agents reason about joint actions
$$\pi^* = \arg\max_\pi \sum_{i=1}^n w_i J^i(\pi)$$

**Opponent Modeling**: Agent $i$ maintains model of other agents
$$\hat{\pi}^{-i} = \arg\max_{\pi^{-i}} P(\tau | \pi^{-i})$$

where $\tau$ represents observed trajectories of other agents.

## 2.2 Coordination Challenges

### Non-Stationarity Problem

From agent $i$'s perspective, the environment is non-stationary due to other learning agents:
$$P_t(s_{t+1}|s_t, a_t^i) \neq P_{t+1}(s_{t+1}|s_t, a_t^i)$$

This violates the stationarity assumption of single-agent RL.

**Addressing Non-Stationarity**:
1. **Experience Replay with Importance Sampling**
2. **Opponent Modeling and Prediction**
3. **Robust Learning Algorithms**
4. **Meta-Learning for Adaptation**

### Credit Assignment

**Multi-Agent Credit Assignment Problem**: How to assign credit/blame to individual agents for collective outcomes.

**Difference Rewards**: 
$$D^i = G(\text{team}) - G(\text{team}_{-i})$$

**Counterfactual Multi-Agent Policy Gradients**: 
$$\nabla_{\theta^i} J^i = \mathbb{E}[\nabla_{\theta^i} \log \pi^i(a^i|o^i) \cdot A^i]$$

Where advantage $A^i$ is computed using counterfactual baselines.

### Communication and Coordination

**Communication Protocols**:
- **Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution (CTDE)**
- **Learned Communication**: Agents learn what and when to communicate
- **Emergent Communication**: Communication protocols emerge from interaction

**Information Sharing**:
- **Parameter Sharing**: Agents share neural network parameters
- **Experience Sharing**: Agents share trajectory data
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Transfer knowledge between agents

## 2.3 MARL Algorithms

### Independent Learning Approaches

**Independent Q-Learning (IQL)**:
Each agent learns independently treating others as environment:
$$Q^i(s, a^i) \leftarrow Q^i(s, a^i) + \alpha[r^i + \gamma \max_{a'^i} Q^i(s', a'^i) - Q^i(s, a^i)]$$

**Independent Actor-Critic**:
Each agent maintains separate actor and critic networks.

**Problems with Independence**:
- Non-stationarity leads to unstable learning
- Suboptimal coordination
- No explicit cooperation mechanism

### Centralized Training Approaches

**Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG)**:
- **Centralized Critic**: $Q^i(s, a^1, \ldots, a^n)$ observes global information
- **Decentralized Actor**: $\pi^i(a^i|o^i)$ uses only local observations
- **Training**: Centralized with full observability
- **Execution**: Decentralized with partial observability

**Policy Gradient Update**:
$$\nabla_{\theta^i} J^i = \mathbb{E}[\nabla_{\theta^i} \pi^i(a^i|o^i) \nabla_{a^i} Q^i(s, a^1, \ldots, a^n)|_{a^i = \pi^i(o^i)}]$$

### Value Decomposition Methods

**Value Decomposition Networks (VDN)**:
$$Q_{\text{tot}}(s, a^1, \ldots, a^n) = \sum_{i=1}^n Q^i(o^i, a^i)$$

**QMIX**: 
$$Q_{\text{tot}}(s, \mathbf{a}) = f_{\text{mix}}(Q^1(o^1, a^1), \ldots, Q^n(o^n, a^n), s)$$

Where $f_{\text{mix}}$ is a mixing network that ensures:
$$\frac{\partial Q_{\text{tot}}}{\partial Q^i} \geq 0 \quad \forall i$$

This ensures individual-global-max (IGM) principle.

### Communication-Based Methods

**Differentiable Inter-Agent Communication (DIAL)**:
Agents learn to communicate through differentiable channels:
$$m^i_t = \text{CommNet}^i(h^i_t, m^{-i}_{t-1})$$
$$a^i_t = \text{ActionNet}^i(h^i_t, m^{-i}_t)$$

**Graph Neural Networks for MARL**:
Model agents and their relationships as graphs:
$$h^i_{t+1} = \text{GNN}(h^i_t, \{h^j_t : j \in \mathcal{N}(i)\})$$

## 2.4 Advanced MARL Concepts

### Emergent Behaviors

**Emergence**: Complex collective behaviors arising from simple individual rules.

**Examples**:
- Flocking and swarming behaviors
- Role specialization in teams
- Communication protocols
- Competitive strategies

**Measuring Emergence**:
- **Mutual Information** between agent behaviors
- **Entropy** of collective behaviors
- **Complexity Measures** of emergent patterns

### Multi-Agent Meta-Learning

**Learning to Adapt to New Opponents**:
$$\phi^i = \text{MetaLearner}^i(\{(\tau^{-i}_k, \pi^i_k)\}_{k=1}^K)$$

Where $\phi^i$ are meta-parameters for rapid adaptation.

**Model-Agnostic Multi-Agent Meta-Learning (MAML)**:
$$\theta'^i = \theta^i - \alpha \nabla_{\theta^i} \mathcal{L}^i(\theta^i, \mathcal{D}_{\text{support}})$$
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{meta}} = \sum_i \mathcal{L}^i(\theta'^i, \mathcal{D}_{\text{query}})$$

### Multi-Agent Hierarchical RL

**Hierarchical Coordination**:
- **High-level Managers**: Set goals/subgoals for workers
- **Low-level Workers**: Execute primitive actions
- **Temporal Abstraction**: Different time scales for different levels

**Feudal Multi-Agent Hierarchies**:
Manager $i$ sets goals $g^j$ for workers $j$:
$$g^j_t = \text{Manager}^i(s_t, g^i_t)$$
$$a^j_t = \text{Worker}^j(o^j_t, g^j_t)$$

### Population-Based Training

**Training Against Diverse Opponents**:
Maintain population of agents with different strategies:
$$\text{Population} = \{\pi^{(1)}, \pi^{(2)}, \ldots, \pi^{(P)}\}$$

**Evolutionary Approaches**:
- **Selection**: Choose best performing agents
- **Mutation**: Add noise to agent parameters
- **Crossover**: Combine successful agents
- **Diversity Maintenance**: Ensure strategy diversity

**Self-Play Variants**:
- **Naive Self-Play**: Train against copies of self
- **League Play**: Train against diverse historical versions

# Section 3: Causal Reinforcement Learning

Causal Reinforcement Learning integrates causal inference with RL to enable agents to understand and exploit causal relationships in their environment, leading to more robust and interpretable decision-making.

## 3.1 Theoretical Foundations

### Causality in Sequential Decision Making

Traditional RL focuses on correlation between actions and outcomes, but **Causal RL** explicitly models causal relationships to enable:

- **Interventional Reasoning**: Understanding effects of actions (interventions)
- **Counterfactual Reasoning**: "What would have happened if I had acted differently?"
- **Transfer Learning**: Leveraging causal invariances across domains
- **Robustness**: Handling distribution shifts and confounding

### Causal Framework for RL

**Structural Causal Models (SCMs)**:
An SCM is a tuple $\mathcal{M} = \langle \mathbf{U}, \mathbf{V}, \mathcal{F}, P(\mathbf{U}) \rangle$ where:
- $\mathbf{U}$: Exogenous variables (unobserved confounders)
- $\mathbf{V}$: Endogenous variables (observed variables)
- $\mathcal{F}$: Set of functions $v_i = f_i(\text{pa}_i, u_i)$
- $P(\mathbf{U})$: Distribution over exogenous variables

**Causal Graph**: Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representing causal relationships.

**Do-Calculus in RL**:
The effect of intervention $do(A = a)$ on outcome $Y$:
$$P(Y | do(A = a)) = \sum_z P(Y | A = a, Z = z) P(Z)$$

when $Z$ is a valid adjustment set.

### Intervention vs. Observation

**Observational Distribution**: $P(Y | A = a)$ - seeing action $a$
**Interventional Distribution**: $P(Y | do(A = a))$ - forcing action $a$

**Confounding**: When $P(Y | A = a) \neq P(Y | do(A = a))$ due to unobserved confounders.

**Example in RL**:
- **Observational**: "Agents who take action $a$ in state $s$ get reward $r$"
- **Interventional**: "If we force action $a$ in state $s$, we get reward $r$"

## 3.2 Causal Discovery in RL

### Learning Causal Structure

**Constraint-Based Methods**:
Use conditional independence tests to learn causal structure:
$$X \perp Y | Z \text{ if } I(X; Y | Z) = 0$$

**Score-Based Methods**:
Learn structure by optimizing a scoring function:
$$\text{Score}(\mathcal{G}) = \text{Fit}(\mathcal{G}, \mathcal{D}) - \text{Complexity}(\mathcal{G})$$

**PC Algorithm for RL**:
1. Start with complete graph
2. Remove edges using conditional independence tests
3. Orient edges using collider detection
4. Apply orientation rules

### Temporal Causal Discovery

**Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs)**:
Model causal relationships across time:
$$X_{t+1} = f(X_t, A_t, U_t)$$

**Granger Causality**:
$X$ Granger-causes $Y$ if past values of $X$ help predict $Y$:
$$\text{GC}(X \rightarrow Y) = \log \frac{\text{Var}(Y_{t+1} | Y_{\leq t})}{\text{Var}(Y_{t+1} | Y_{\leq t}, X_{\leq t})}$$

**Causal Discovery with Interventions**:
Use agent's actions as interventions to identify causal relationships:
$$P(S_{t+1} | do(A_t = a), S_t = s) \text{ vs. } P(S_{t+1} | A_t = a, S_t = s)$$

## 3.3 Causal Representation Learning

### Learning Causal Variables

**Disentangled Representations**:
Learn representations where each dimension corresponds to a causally meaningful factor:
$$z = [z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_k] \text{ where } z_i \text{ represents factor } i$$

**β-VAE for Causal Discovery**:
$$\mathcal{L} = \text{Reconstruction Loss} + \beta \cdot \text{KL}(q(z|x) || p(z))$$

Higher $\beta$ encourages disentanglement.

**Causal VAE**:
Incorporate causal structure in latent space:
$$z_{i,t+1} = f_i(\text{pa}(z_{i,t+1}), u_{i,t})$$

### Invariant Causal Prediction (ICP)

**Principle**: Causal relationships are invariant across environments.

**ICP Algorithm**:
1. For each variable, find subsets of parents that remain stable across environments
2. Intersection of stable sets identifies causal parents
3. Use for robust prediction under distribution shifts

**Mathematical Formulation**:
$$S^* = \bigcap_{e \in \mathcal{E}} S_e$$

where $S_e$ is the set of stable predictors in environment $e$.

## 3.4 Counterfactual Policy Evaluation

### Counterfactual Reasoning

**Counterfactual Query**: "What would have happened if the agent had taken action $a'$ instead of $a$ at time $t$?"

**Three-Level Hierarchy** (Pearl):
1. **Association**: $P(Y | X)$ - seeing
2. **Intervention**: $P(Y | do(X))$ - doing  
3. **Counterfactuals**: $P(Y_x | X', Y')$ - imagining

### Off-Policy Policy Evaluation with Confounders

**Standard Importance Sampling**:
$$V^{\pi}(s) = \mathbb{E}_{\mu}\left[\frac{\pi(a|s)}{\mu(a|s)} R \mid S = s\right]$$

**Problem**: Fails when there are unobserved confounders affecting both actions and rewards.

**Causal Importance Sampling**:
Control for confounders using front-door or back-door adjustment:
$$V^{\pi}(s) = \sum_{z} \mathbb{E}_{\mu}\left[\frac{\pi(a|s)}{\mu(a|s)} R \mid S = s, Z = z\right] P(Z = z | S = s)$$

### Counterfactual Policy Gradient

**Causal Policy Gradient**:
$$\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi_\theta}\left[\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s) \cdot Q^{\pi_\theta}_{\text{causal}}(s, a)\right]$$

where $Q^{\pi_\theta}_{\text{causal}}$ is the causal Q-function accounting for confounders.

**Doubly Robust Estimation**:
$$\hat{Q}(s, a) = \mu(s, a) + \frac{\pi(a|s)}{\mu(a|s)} (r + \gamma V(s') - \mu(s, a))$$

Combines model-based and importance-sampling estimators.

## 3.5 Causal Mechanisms and Invariances

### Modular Causal Mechanisms

**Independent Causal Mechanisms (ICM)**:
Causal mechanisms are modular and independent:
$$P(X_1, \ldots, X_n) = \prod_{i=1}^n P(X_i | \text{pa}(X_i))$$

**Sparse Mechanism Shifts**:
When environment changes, only a few mechanisms change:
$$\mathcal{M}^{(e)} = \mathcal{M} \setminus \mathcal{M}_{\text{changed}}^{(e)} \cup \mathcal{M}_{\text{new}}^{(e)}$$

### Causal Adaptation

**Domain Adaptation via Causal Invariance**:
Learn representations that remain invariant to spurious correlations:
$$\min_\phi \sum_{e=1}^E \mathcal{L}_e(\phi) + \lambda \cdot \text{Penalty}(\phi)$$

**Penalty Term**: Encourages invariance across environments:
$$\text{Penalty}(\phi) = \sum_{e,e'} ||\nabla_\phi \mathcal{L}_e(\phi) - \nabla_\phi \mathcal{L}_{e'}(\phi)||^2$$

### Causal World Models

**Causal Transition Models**:
Learn transition models that respect causal structure:
$$P(S_{t+1} | S_t, A_t) = \prod_{i=1}^n P(S_{i,t+1} | \text{pa}(S_{i,t+1}))$$

**Interventional World Models**:
Model effects of actions as interventions:
$$P(S_{t+1} | do(A_t = a), S_t = s)$$

**Benefits**:
- Better generalization to unseen action distributions
- Robustness to confounding
- Interpretable decision-making

## 3.6 Applications and Algorithms

### Causal Bandits

**Contextual Bandits with Confounders**:
Learn optimal policy when contexts affect both actions and rewards.

**Deconfounded Thompson Sampling**:
1. Learn causal graph structure
2. Identify valid adjustment sets
3. Use adjusted rewards for Thompson sampling

### Causal Model-Based RL

**Algorithm: Causal MBRL**
1. **Structure Learning**: Learn causal DAG from data
2. **Mechanism Learning**: Learn causal mechanisms $P(X_j | \text{pa}(X_j))$
3. **Planning**: Use learned model for interventional planning
4. **Adaptation**: Update mechanisms when environment changes

**Causal Planning**:
```
function CausalPlan(state, causal_model, horizon):
    for action in action_space:
        # Simulate intervention
        future_reward = simulate_do(action, state, causal_model, horizon)
        action_values[action] = future_reward
    return argmax(action_values)
```

### Robust Policy Learning

**Domain Randomization with Causal Structure**:
Vary non-causal factors while preserving causal relationships:
$$\text{Randomize}(\text{spurious\_factors}) \text{ while } \text{Fix}(\text{causal\_factors})$$

**Causal Regularization**:
Add regularization term to encourage causal invariance:
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{RL}} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}}$$

where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}}$ penalizes violations of causal assumptions.

## 3.7 Evaluation Metrics

### Causal Discovery Metrics

**Structural Hamming Distance (SHD)**:
Number of edge additions, deletions, and reversals to transform learned graph to true graph.

**Expected Causal Effect Error**:
$$\text{ECE} = \mathbb{E}_{X,Y} ||\text{ACE}_{\text{true}}(X \rightarrow Y) - \text{ACE}_{\text{learned}}(X \rightarrow Y)||$$

### Policy Evaluation Metrics

**Interventional Accuracy**:
How well the learned policy performs under interventions:
$$\text{IA} = \mathbb{E}_{s,a}[V^{\pi}(s) - V^{\pi}_{\text{do}(a)}(s)]$$

**Robustness to Distribution Shift**:
Performance degradation under covariate shift:
$$\text{Robustness} = 1 - \frac{|J_{\text{target}} - J_{\text{source}}|}{J_{\text{source}}}$$

### Counterfactual Evaluation

**Counterfactual Policy Value**:
$$V^{\pi}_{\text{CF}}(s) = \mathbb{E}[\sum_t \gamma^t R_t | S_0 = s, \text{CF policy } \pi]$$

**Regret Bounds**:
Upper bounds on suboptimality due to causal misspecification.

# Section 5: Federated Reinforcement Learning

## 5.1 Theoretical Foundations

### Federated Learning Paradigm in RL

**Federated Learning Framework**
- Decentralized learning across multiple agents/clients
- Local model training with periodic global aggregation
- Privacy-preserving collaborative learning
- Communication efficiency and fault tolerance

**Mathematical Foundation**
Let $\mathcal{C} = \{1, 2, ..., C\}$ be the set of clients, each with:
- Local dataset $\mathcal{D}_c$ with environment interactions
- Local policy $\pi_c^{\theta_c}$ parameterized by $\theta_c$
- Local value function $V_c^{\phi_c}$ parameterized by $\phi_c$

Global objective:
$$J^{FRL} = \sum_{c=1}^C w_c J_c(\theta_c)$$
where $w_c = \frac{|\mathcal{D}_c|}{\sum_{i=1}^C |\mathcal{D}_i|}$ are client weights.

### Federated RL Communication Protocols

**1. FedAvg-RL (Federated Averaging for RL)**
```
Global model update:
θ^{t+1} = Σ_{c=1}^C w_c θ_c^{t+1}

Local updates:
θ_c^{t+1} = θ_c^t - η_c ∇_θ J_c(θ_c^t)
```

**2. FedProx-RL (Federated Proximal for RL)**
```
Local objective with proximal term:
J_c^{prox}(θ_c) = J_c(θ_c) + (μ/2)||θ_c - θ^t||^2

Addresses client heterogeneity and drift
```

**3. SCAFFOLD-RL (Federated Learning with Control Variates)**
```
Uses control variates to reduce client drift:
θ_c^{t+1} = θ_c^t - η(∇J_c(θ_c^t) - c_c^t + c^t)

Where c_c^t, c^t are local and global control variates
```

### Non-IID Data Challenges

**1. Environment Heterogeneity**
- Different clients face different MDPs
- State/action space variations across clients
- Reward function heterogeneity
- Transition dynamics variation

**2. Data Distribution Skew**
- Feature distribution skew: P_c(s) ≠ P_j(s)
- Label distribution skew: P_c(a|s) ≠ P_j(a|s)
- Temporal distribution shifts
- Concept drift across clients

**3. Client Heterogeneity**
- System heterogeneity (compute, memory, communication)
- Statistical heterogeneity (data distributions)
- Behavioral heterogeneity (exploration patterns)

### Privacy-Preserving Techniques

**1. Differential Privacy in FRL**
Add noise to gradient updates:
$$\tilde{\nabla}_\theta J_c = \nabla_\theta J_c + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 C^2 I)$$

where $C$ is clipping threshold and $\sigma$ provides $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy.

**2. Secure Aggregation**
- Cryptographic techniques for private aggregation
- Homomorphic encryption for gradient computation
- Secret sharing schemes for model parameters

**3. Local Differential Privacy**
Each client privatizes data locally:
$$\tilde{s}_i = s_i + \text{Lap}(\Delta/\epsilon)$$
where $\Delta$ is sensitivity and $\epsilon$ is privacy parameter.

### Federated Policy Gradient Methods

**1. FedPG (Federated Policy Gradient)**

Local policy gradient:
$$g_c^t = \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_c^t}[\sum_{t=0}^T \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_t|s_t) A_c^t(s_t, a_t)]$$

Global aggregation:
$$\theta^{t+1} = \theta^t - \eta \sum_{c=1}^C w_c g_c^t$$

**2. FedAC (Federated Actor-Critic)**
- Separate aggregation for actor and critic networks
- Critic can be shared more frequently than actor
- Local advantage estimation with global value baseline

**3. FedTD (Federated Temporal Difference)**
For value-based methods:
$$V^{t+1} = \sum_{c=1}^C w_c V_c^{t+1}$$
where $V_c^{t+1}$ updated via local TD learning.

### Communication-Efficient Strategies

**1. Gradient Compression**
- Sparsification: Send only top-k gradients
- Quantization: Reduce precision of communicated values
- Sketching: Random projections for dimension reduction

**2. Periodic Communication**
- Local updates for $E$ epochs before communication
- Adaptive communication based on convergence metrics
- Event-triggered communication protocols

**3. Model Compression**
- Knowledge distillation for model size reduction
- Pruning and quantization of neural networks
- Low-rank approximations for parameter matrices

### Convergence Analysis

**Theorem (FedAvg-RL Convergence)**
Under assumptions of bounded gradients and smooth loss functions:

$$\mathbb{E}[||\nabla J(\theta^T)||^2] \leq \frac{2(J(\theta^0) - J^*)}{\eta T} + \frac{\eta L \sigma^2}{C} + \frac{2\eta^2 L^2 E^2 \zeta^2}{C}$$

where:
- $L$: Lipschitz constant
- $\sigma^2$: Gradient variance
- $E$: Local update steps
- $\zeta^2$: Client heterogeneity measure

**Key Insights:**
- Convergence rate depends on client heterogeneity $\zeta^2$
- Communication rounds vs local updates trade-off
- Privacy noise affects convergence rate

### Multi-Task Federated RL

**1. Shared Representation Learning**
Learn common feature extractor $f_\phi$ across clients:
$$\phi^* = \arg\min_\phi \sum_{c=1}^C w_c L_c(f_\phi)$$

**2. Meta-Learning Approach**
Learn initialization that adapts quickly to client tasks:
$$\theta^* = \arg\min_\theta \sum_{c=1}^C L_c(\theta - \alpha \nabla_\theta L_c(\theta))$$

**3. Personalized Federated RL**
Balance global knowledge with local personalization:
$$\theta_c^{pers} = \lambda \theta^{global} + (1-\lambda) \theta_c^{local}$$

### Robustness and Byzantine Tolerance

**1. Byzantine-Robust Aggregation**
- Coordinate-wise median aggregation
- Trimmed mean aggregation
- Geometric median computation

**2. Anomaly Detection**
Detect malicious clients via:
- Statistical tests on gradient distributions
- Distance-based outlier detection
- Clustering-based anomaly identification

**3. Robust Federated Learning**
Minimize worst-case client loss:
$$\min_\theta \max_{c \in \mathcal{C}} J_c(\theta)$$

### Asynchronous Federated RL

**1. Asynchronous Model Updates**
- Clients update at different rates
- Staleness-aware aggregation
- Age-based weighting schemes

**2. FedAsync Algorithm**
```
Upon receiving update from client c:
α_c = staleness_weight(τ_c)
θ^{t+1} = θ^t - α_c η g_c

Where τ_c is staleness of client c's update
```

### Hierarchical Federated RL

**1. Two-Level Federation**
- Edge servers aggregate local clusters
- Cloud server aggregates edge models
- Reduces communication to central server

**2. Clustered Federated RL**
Group similar clients for specialized models:
- Cluster clients by environment similarity
- Separate federation within each cluster
- Cross-cluster knowledge transfer

### Applications and Use Cases

**1. Autonomous Vehicle Networks**
- Fleet learning for navigation policies
- Privacy-preserving trajectory sharing
- Collaborative perception and decision making

**2. IoT and Edge Computing**
- Distributed sensor network optimization
- Resource allocation in edge computing
- Smart city traffic management

**3. Financial Services**
- Collaborative fraud detection
- Credit scoring without data sharing
- Algorithmic trading strategy learning

**4. Healthcare Systems**
- Medical treatment policy learning
- Drug discovery collaboration
- Epidemiological modeling

**5. Robotics and Manufacturing**
- Industrial robot coordination
- Supply chain optimization
- Quality control policy learning

### Performance Metrics

**1. Convergence Metrics**
- Global model accuracy/reward
- Communication rounds to convergence
- Local computation vs communication trade-off

**2. Privacy Metrics**
- Differential privacy guarantees
- Information leakage bounds
- Membership inference attack resistance

**3. Fairness Metrics**
- Per-client performance variance
- Worst-case client performance
- Equitable resource allocation

This comprehensive theoretical foundation establishes the principles, algorithms, and challenges of federated reinforcement learning, providing the mathematical framework for implementing privacy-preserving, communication-efficient collaborative RL systems.

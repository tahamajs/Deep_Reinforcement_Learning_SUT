## Overview

This comprehensive assignment explores the frontiers of deep reinforcement learning by combining model-based and hierarchical approaches.

# Collect environment data
trajectories = []
for episode in range(100):
    trajectory = collect_trajectory(env)
    trajectories.append(trajectory)

# Train model on collected data

```python
# Create MCTS planner with neural network guidance
mcts = MonteCarloTreeSearch(
    model=model_ensemble,
    value_network=value_net,
    policy_network=policy_net
)

# Use MCTS for decision making
for episode in range(100):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False

    while not done:
        # Run MCTS search
        root = mcts.search(state, num_simulations=200)

        # Get action probabilities
        action_probs = mcts.get_action_probabilities(root)

        # Select action (with temperature for exploration)
        action = sample_from_probabilities(action_probs, temperature=0.5)

        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        state = next_state
```

### World Model Training

```python
# Create world model
world_model = WorldModel(obs_dim=10, action_dim=4, latent_dim=64)

# Training data
observations = collect_observations(env, num_episodes=1000)
actions = collect_actions(env, num_episodes=1000)

# Train world model
optimizer = optim.Adam(world_model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)
for epoch in range(100):
    # Forward pass
    output = world_model(observations, actions)

    # Reconstruction loss
    recon_loss = F.mse_loss(output['predicted_obs'], observations[:, 1:])

    # Reward prediction loss
    reward_loss = F.mse_loss(output['predicted_rewards'], rewards)

    # KL divergence for latent space
    kl_loss = -0.5 * torch.sum(
        1 + output['latent_log_std'] - output['latent_mean'].pow(2) - output['latent_log_std'].exp()
    )

    # Total loss
    loss = recon_loss + reward_loss + 0.1 * kl_loss

    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

    "# Section 1: Offline Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Theory: Learning from Static Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Offline Reinforcement Learning (also known as **Batch RL** or **Data-Driven RL**) addresses the challenge of learning optimal policies from pre-collected datasets without further environment interaction. This paradigm is crucial for real-world applications where online exploration is expensive, dangerous, or impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Challenges in Offline Rl\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Distribution Shift Problem\n",
    "The fundamental challenge in offline RL is the **distributional shift** between the behavior policy that generated the data and the learned policy:\n",
    "- **Behavior Policy**: $\\pi_\\beta(a|s)$ - Policy that collected the dataset\n",
    "- **Learned Policy**: $\\pi(a|s)$ - Policy we want to optimize\n",
    "- **Distribution Mismatch**: $\\pi(a|s) \\neq \\pi_\\beta(a|s)$ leads to extrapolation errors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Overestimation Bias\n",
    "Standard off-policy methods suffer from **overestimation bias** in offline settings:\n",
    "$$Q(s,a) = \\mathbb{E}[r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s', a')] \\text{ (overestimates for unseen actions)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Coverage Problem\n",
    "Limited dataset coverage leads to poor generalization:\n",
    "- **Good Coverage**: Dataset contains diverse state-action pairs\n",
    "- **Poor Coverage**: Dataset is narrow, missing important regions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Offline Rl Objective\n",
    "The goal is to maximize expected return using only offline data $\\mathcal{D} = \\{(s*i, a*i, r*i, s'*i)\\}_{i=1}^N$:\n",
    "$$J(\\pi) = \\mathbb{E}*{\\pi, \\mathcal{D}}[\\sum*{t=0}^T \\gamma^t r_t] \\text{ subject to } (s,a) \\in \\text{support}(\\mathcal{D})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conservative Q-learning (cql) Objective\n",
    "CQL addresses overestimation by adding a conservative penalty:\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}*{CQL}(Q) = \\alpha \\mathbb{E}*{s \\sim \\mathcal{D}}\\left[\\log \\sum*a \\exp Q(s,a) - \\mathbb{E}*{a \\sim \\pi*\\beta(a|s)}[Q(s,a)]\\right] + \\mathcal{L}*{Bellman}(Q)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- **Conservative Term**: Penalizes high Q-values for out-of-distribution actions\n",
    "- **Bellman Loss**: Standard temporal difference learning objective\n",
    "- **$\\alpha$**: Conservative weight hyperparameter\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Behavior Cloning Regularization\n",
    "Many offline RL methods incorporate behavior cloning to stay close to the data distribution:\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}*{BC}(\\pi) = \\mathbb{E}*{(s,a) \\sim \\mathcal{D}}[-\\log \\pi(a|s)]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Advanced Offline Rl Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Conservative Q-learning (cql)\n",
    "- **Idea**: Lower-bound Q-values for unseen actions while fitting seen data\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Prevents overestimation bias effectively\n",
    "- **Use Case**: High-dimensional continuous control tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Implicit Q-learning (iql)\n",
    "- **Idea**: Avoid explicit policy improvement, use implicit Q-function updates\n",
    "- **Advantage**: More stable than explicit policy optimization\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Mixed-quality datasets with suboptimal trajectories\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Advantage-weighted Regression (awr)\n",
    "- **Idea**: Weight behavior cloning by advantage estimates\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Simple and effective for good-quality datasets\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Near-optimal demonstration datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Batch-constrained Deep Q-learning (bcq)\n",
    "- **Idea**: Constrain policy to stay close to behavior policy\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Explicit distribution constraint\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Discrete action spaces with coverage issues"

    "\n",
    "#### Multi-agent Markov Decision Process (ma-mdp)\n",
    "A Multi-Agent MDP is defined as:\n",

    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- **$\\mathcal{N} = \\{1, 2, ..., n\\}$**: Set of agents\n",
    "- **$\\mathcal{S}$**: Global state space\n",
    "- **$\\mathcal{A}_i$**: Action space for agent $i$\n",
    "- **$P: \\mathcal{S} \\times \\mathcal{A}*1 \\times ... \\times \\mathcal{A}*n \\rightarrow \\Delta(\\mathcal{S})$**: Transition function\n",

    "#### Joint Policy and Nash Equilibrium\n",
    "The **joint policy** $\\pi = (\\pi*1, ..., \\pi*n)$ where $\\pi_i$ is agent $i$'s policy.\n",

    "#### 2. Exponential Joint Action Space\n",
    "The joint action space grows exponentially: $|\\mathcal{A}| = \\prod*{i=1}^n |\\mathcal{A}*i|$\n",

    "\n",
    "## 4.1 Theory: Handling Uncertainty and Adversarial Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Robust Reinforcement Learning addresses the challenge of learning policies that perform well under uncertainty, distributional shifts, and adversarial conditions. This is crucial for deploying RL agents in real-world environments where training and testing conditions may differ significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sources of Uncertainty in Rl\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Model Uncertainty\n",
    "- **Transition Dynamics**: $P(s'|s,a)$ may be unknown or changing\n",
    "- **Reward Function**: $R(s,a)$ may be noisy or non-stationary\n",
    "- **Initial State Distribution**: $\\mu_0(s)$ may vary between episodes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Environmental Uncertainty\n",
    "- **Observation Noise**: $o*t = s*t + \\epsilon*t$ where $\\epsilon*t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$\n",
    "- **Partial Observability**: Agent only observes $o*t$ instead of full state $s*t$\n",
    "- **Dynamic Environments**: Environment parameters change over time\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Distributional Shift\n",
    "- **Covariate Shift**: $P*{train}(s) \\neq P*{test}(s)$\n",
    "- **Concept Drift**: $P*{train}(s'|s,a) \\neq P*{test}(s'|s,a)$\n",
    "- **Domain Gap**: Training and deployment environments differ\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Framework for Robust Rl\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Robust Markov Decision Process (rmdp)\n",
    "An RMDP extends the standard MDP to handle uncertainty:\n",
    "$$\\text{RMDP} = (\\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{P}, \\mathcal{R}, \\gamma, \\mu_0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- **$\\mathcal{P}$**: Uncertainty set of transition kernels\n",
    "- **$\\mathcal{R}$**: Uncertainty set of reward functions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Robust Value Function\n",
    "The robust value function considers worst-case scenarios:\n",
    "$$V^{\\pi}*{robust}(s) = \\min*{P \\in \\mathcal{P}, R \\in \\mathcal{R}} V^{\\pi}_{P,R}(s)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Distributionally Robust Optimization (dro)\n",
    "Optimize performance over a set of probability distributions:\n",
    "$$\\max*\\pi \\min*{P \\in \\mathcal{P}} \\mathbb{E}*{P}[\\sum*{t=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^t R(s*t, a*t)]$$\n",

    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Formulation**:\n",
    "$$J*{DR}(\\pi) = \\mathbb{E}*{\\theta \\sim p(\\theta)}[J_\\theta(\\pi)]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Adversarial Training\n",
    "**Idea**: Train against adversarial perturbations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Min-Max Objective**:\n",
    "$$\\max*\\pi \\min*{\\delta} \\mathbb{E}[R(s + \\delta, \\pi(s + \\delta))]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Subject to: $||\\delta|| \\leq \\epsilon$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Distributional Rl for Robustness\n",
    "**Idea**: Model full return distribution instead of expected value\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantile Regression**:\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}(\\tau, \\hat{Z}) = \\mathbb{E}[(\\tau - \\mathbb{1}_{z < \\hat{Z}(\\tau)})(z - \\hat{Z}(\\tau))]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Bayesian Rl\n",
    "**Idea**: Maintain uncertainty over model parameters\n",

    "### 2. Coherent Risk Measures\n",
    "Risk measure $\\rho$ is coherent if it satisfies:\n",
    "- **Monotonicity**: $X \\geq Y \\Rightarrow \\rho(X) \\leq \\rho(Y)$\n",
    "- **Translation Invariance**: $\\rho(X + c) = \\rho(X) - c$\n",
    "- **Positive Homogeneity**: $\\rho(cX) = c\\rho(X)$ for $c \\geq 0$\n",
    "- **Subadditivity**: $\\rho(X + Y) \\leq \\rho(X) + \\rho(Y)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Entropic Risk Measure\n",
    "$$\\rho_\\beta(Z) = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\log \\mathbb{E}[e^{-\\beta Z}]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.3 Uncertainty Quantification\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Epistemic Vs Aleatoric Uncertainty\n",
    "- **Epistemic**: Model uncertainty (reducible with more data)\n",

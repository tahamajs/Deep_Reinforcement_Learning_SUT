    "# Computer Assignment 13: Advanced Model-Based RL and World Models\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment presents a comprehensive study of advanced model-based reinforcement learning and world models, exploring the cutting-edge techniques for learning compressed representations of environments and using them for efficient planning and control. We implement and analyze world model architectures including variational autoencoders, recurrent state space models, and latent space planning methods. The assignment covers modern approaches such as World Models, Dreamer, PlaNet, and MuZero, demonstrating their effectiveness in achieving sample-efficient learning through imagination-based planning. Through systematic experimentation, we show how world models can significantly improve sample efficiency while maintaining competitive performance compared to model-free methods.\n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced model-based reinforcement learning with world models represents a significant advancement in the field, enabling agents to learn compressed representations of complex environments and use these representations for efficient planning and decision-making [1]. Unlike traditional model-based approaches that learn explicit environment dynamics, world models learn latent representations that capture the essential aspects of the environment while being computationally tractable for planning and imagination.\n",

    "- **Sample Efficiency**: Enable planning and imagination without additional environment interaction\n",
    "- **Generalization**: Learn representations that generalize across different environments and tasks\n",
    "- **Computational Efficiency**: Reduce the computational cost of planning through compressed representations\n",
    "- **Long-term Dependencies**: Capture temporal dependencies and long-term consequences of actions\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Master World Model Architectures**: Design and implement variational world models using VAEs for learning compact latent representations of environment dynamics, including encoder-decoder architectures and stochastic dynamics modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Implement Imagination-Based Learning**: Develop agents that leverage learned world models for planning and decision-making in latent space, enabling sample-efficient learning through imagined trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Apply Sample Efficiency Techniques**: Utilize advanced techniques such as prioritized experience replay, data augmentation, and auxiliary tasks to improve learning efficiency in deep RL.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Design Transfer Learning Systems**: Build agents capable of transferring knowledge across related tasks through shared representations, fine-tuning, and meta-learning approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Develop Hierarchical RL Frameworks**: Implement hierarchical decision-making systems using options framework, enabling temporal abstraction and skill composition for complex task solving.\n",

    "## 4.1 Theory: Hierarchical Decision Making\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) addresses the challenge of learning complex behaviors by decomposing tasks into hierarchical structures. This approach enables agents to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Learn at Multiple Time Scales**: High-level policies select goals or skills, while low-level policies execute primitive actions\n",
    "2. **Achieve Better Generalization**: Skills learned in one context can be reused in others\n",
    "3. **Improve Sample Efficiency**: By leveraging temporal abstractions and skill composition\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Options Framework\n",
    "An **option** $\\omega$ is defined by a tuple $(I*\\omega, \\pi*\\omega, \\beta_\\omega)$:\n",
    "- **Initiation Set** $I_\\omega \\subseteq \\mathcal{S}$: States where the option can be initiated\n",
    "- **Policy** $\\pi_\\omega: \\mathcal{S} \\times \\mathcal{A} \\rightarrow [0,1]$: Action selection within the option\n",
    "- **Termination Condition** $\\beta_\\omega: \\mathcal{S} \\rightarrow [0,1]$: Probability of termination\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hierarchical Value Functions\n",
    "The value function for options follows the Bellman equation:\n",
    "$$Q^\\pi(s,\\omega) = \\mathbb{E}*\\pi\\left[\\sum*{t=0}^{\\tau-1} \\gamma^t r*{t+1} + \\gamma^\\tau Q^\\pi(s*\\tau, \\omega') \\mid s*0=s, \\omega*0=\\omega\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\tau$ is the termination time and $\\omega'$ is the next option selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feudal Networks\n",
    "Feudal Networks implement a manager-worker hierarchy:\n",
    "- **Manager Network**: Sets goals $g*t$ for workers: $g*t = f*{manager}(s*t, h_{t-1}^{manager})$\n",
    "- **Worker Network**: Executes actions conditioned on goals: $a*t = \\pi*{worker}(s*t, g*t)$\n",
    "- **Intrinsic Motivation**: Workers receive intrinsic rewards based on goal achievement\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intrinsic Reward Signal\n",
    "The intrinsic reward for achieving subgoals:\n",
    "$$r*t^{intrinsic} = \\cos(\\text{achieved\\*goal}*t - \\text{desired\\*goal}*t) \\cdot ||s*{t+1} - s_t||$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hierarchical Policy Gradient\n",
    "The gradient for the manager policy:\n",
    "$$\\nabla*{\\theta*m} J*m = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\nabla*{\\theta*m} \\log \\pi*m(g*t|s*t) \\cdot A*m(s*t, g_t)\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And for the worker policy:\n",
    "$$\\nabla*{\\theta*w} J*w = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\nabla*{\\theta*w} \\log \\pi*w(a*t|s*t, g*t) \\cdot A*w(s*t, a*t, g_t)\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.2 Implementation: Hierarchical Rl Architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll implement several HRL approaches:\n",
    "1. **Options-Critic Architecture**: Learn options and policies jointly\n",
    "2. **Feudal Networks**: Manager-worker hierarchies\n",
    "3. **Hindsight Experience Replay with Goals**: Sample efficiency for goal-conditioned tasks"

    "- **Hybrid**: Combines benefits of both approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### World Models\n",
    "- VAE-based compression enables efficient latent-space planning\n",

    "- **Data Augmentation**: Improve robustness and generalization\n",
    "- **Auxiliary Tasks**: Learn richer representations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hierarchical RL\n",

    "3. **Validate Carefully**: Check each component independently\n",
    "4. **Monitor Bias**: Watch for model bias in model-based methods\n",
    "5. **Balance Complexity**: More advanced ≠ always better\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.5 Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced deep RL combines multiple sophisticated techniques to achieve:\n",
    "- **Sample Efficiency**: Learn from limited data\n",
    "- **Generalization**: Transfer across tasks and domains\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Handle complex, high-dimensional problems\n",

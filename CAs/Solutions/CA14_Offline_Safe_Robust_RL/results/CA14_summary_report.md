# CA14 Advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning - Summary Report

## Project Overview
This project implements and evaluates advanced deep reinforcement learning methods including:

### 1. Offline Reinforcement Learning
- **Conservative Q-Learning (CQL)**: Prevents overestimation bias with conservative penalties
- **Implicit Q-Learning (IQL)**: Avoids explicit policy improvement through expectile regression

### 2. Safe Reinforcement Learning  
- **Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO)**: Trust-region methods with constraint satisfaction
- **Lagrangian Methods**: Adaptive penalty balancing performance and safety

### 3. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
- **MADDPG**: Centralized training with decentralized execution
- **QMIX**: Monotonic value function factorization for team coordination

### 4. Robust Reinforcement Learning
- **Domain Randomization**: Training across diverse environment configurations
- **Adversarial Training**: Robustness to input perturbations and model uncertainty

## Key Features
- ✅ Complete implementations of all major algorithms
- ✅ Comprehensive evaluation framework
- ✅ Multi-dimensional performance analysis
- ✅ Real-world deployment considerations
- ✅ Extensive visualization and reporting

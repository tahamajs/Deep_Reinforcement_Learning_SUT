    "# Computer Assignment 3: Temporal Difference Learning and Q-Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment presents a comprehensive study of temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms in reinforcement learning, focusing on model-free methods that enable agents to learn optimal policies directly from experience without requiring complete knowledge of environment dynamics. We implement and analyze three fundamental TD algorithms: TD(0) for policy evaluation, Q-learning for off-policy control, and SARSA for on-policy control. Through systematic experimentation on a gridworld environment, we demonstrate the convergence properties, performance characteristics, and practical trade-offs of these algorithms. Our results show that Q-learning achieves optimal performance with 100% success rate, while SARSA provides more conservative but stable learning behavior. The analysis includes exploration strategy comparisons and parameter sensitivity studies, providing insights into algorithm selection for different reinforcement learning scenarios.\n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporal difference (TD) learning represents a fundamental paradigm in reinforcement learning that combines the advantages of Monte Carlo methods and dynamic programming [1]. Unlike model-based approaches that require complete knowledge of state transition probabilities and reward functions, TD methods learn directly from experience through bootstrapping, making them particularly suitable for real-world applications where environment models are unknown or difficult to obtain [2].\n",

    "### 2.1 Temporal Difference Learning Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporal difference learning addresses the fundamental challenge of learning value functions from experience without requiring a complete model of the environment. The core idea is to update value estimates based on the difference between predicted and observed values, a concept known as bootstrapping [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "The general TD update rule can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V(S_t) \\leftarrow V(S_t) + \\alpha [R_{t+1} + \\gamma V(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t)]$$\n",
    "\n",

    "- $\\alpha$ is the learning rate parameter\n",
    "- $R_{t+1}$ is the immediate reward received\n",
    "- $\\gamma$ is the discount factor\n",
    "- $R_{t+1} + \\gamma V(S_{t+1})$ is the TD target\n",
    "- $R_{t+1} + \\gamma V(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t)$ is the TD error\n",
    "\n",

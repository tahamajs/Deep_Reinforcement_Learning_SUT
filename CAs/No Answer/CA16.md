Reframes Rl as a Sequence Modeling Problem, Where the Goal Is to Generate Actions Conditioned on Desired Returns.**key Insight**: Instead of Learning Value Functions or Policy Gradients, We Model:$$p(a*t | S*{1:T}, A*{1:T-1}, R*{t:t})$$where $r*{t:t}$ Represents the Desired Return-to-go from Time $T$ to Episode End $T$.### Trajectory Transformersextend Transformers to Model Entire

and Collaboration to Achieve Superhuman Performance.## 3.1 Theoretical Foundations### THE Human-ai Collaboration Paradigmtraditional Rl Assumes Agents Learn Independently from Environment Feedback. **human-ai Collaborative Learning** Extends This by Incorporating Human Intelligence:- **human Expertise Integration**: Leverage Human Domain Knowledge and Intuition- **interactive Learning**: Real-time Human Feedback during Agent Training- **shared Control**: Dynamic Handoff between Human and Ai Decision-making- **explanatory Ai**: Ai Explains Decisions to Humans for Better Collaboration### Learning from Human Feedback (rlhf)**preference-based Learning**:instead of Engineering Reward Functions, Learn from Human Preferences:$$r*{\theta}(s, A) = \text{rewardmodel}*{\theta}(s, A)$$where the Reward Model Is Trained on Human Preference Data:$$\mathcal{d} = \{(s*i, A*I^1, A*I^2, Y*i)\}$$where $Y*I \IN \{0, 1\}$ Indicates Whether Human Prefers Action $A*I^1$ over $A*I^2$ in State $s*i$.**bradley-terry Model** for PREFERENCES:$$P(A^1 \succ A^2 | S) = \frac{\exp(r*{\theta}(s, A^1))}{\EXP(R*{\THETA}(S, A^1)) + \exp(r*{\theta}(s, A^2))}$$**TRAINING Objective**:$$\mathcal{l}(\theta) = -\MATHBB{E}*{(S,A^1,A^2,Y) \SIM \mathcal{d}}[y \LOG P(A^1 \succ A^2 | S) + (1-Y) \LOG P(A^2 \succ A^1 | S)]$$### Interactive Imitation

Train Policy $\pi*i$ on Current Dataset $\MATHCAL{D}*I$2. Execute $\pi*i$ to Collect States $\{S*T\}$3. Query Expert for Optimal Actions $\{a*t^*\}$ on $\{S*T\}$4. Aggregate: $\MATHCAL{D}*{I+1} = \mathcal{d}*i \CUP \{(s*t, A*t^*)\}$**smile (safe Multi-agent Imitation Learning)**:learn from Multiple Human Experts with Safety Constraints:$$\pi^* = \arg\min*\pi \sum*i W*i \mathcal{l}*{\text{imitation}}(\pi, \pi*i^{\text{expert}}) + \lambda \mathcal{l}*{\text{safety}}(\pi)$$### Shared Autonomy and Control**arbitration between Human and Ai**:dynamic Switching between Human and Ai Control:$$a*t = \begin{cases}a*t^{\text{human}} & \text{if } \alpha*t > \TAU \\a*t^{\text{ai}} & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$where $\alpha*t$ Represents Human Authority Level at Time $t$.**confidence-based Handoff**:$$\alpha*t = F(\text{confidence}*{\text{ai}}(s*t), \text{urgency}(s*t), \text{human\*availability}(t))$$**blended Control**:combine Human and Ai Actions Based on Context:$$a*t = W*t \cdot A*t^{\text{human}} + (1 - W*t) \cdot A*t^{\text{ai}}$$### Trust and Calibration**trust Modeling**:model Human Trust in Ai DECISIONS:$$T*{T+1} = T*t + \alpha \cdot (\text{outcome}*t - T*t) \cdot \text{surprise}*t$$where:- $t*t$: Trust Level at Time $T$- $\text{outcome}*t$: Actual Performance Outcome- $\text{surprise}*t$: Difference between Expected and Actual Outcome**calibrated Confidence**:ensure Ai Confidence Matches Actual Performance:$$\text{calibration Error} = \mathbb{e}[|\text{confidence} - \text{accuracy}|]$$**trust-aware Policy**:modify Policy to Maintain Appropriate Human Trust:$$\pi*{\text{trust}}(a|s) = \pi(a|s) \cdot F*{\text{trust}}(a, S, T*t)$$## 3.2 Human Feedback Integration Methods### Critiquing and Adviceallow Humans to Provide Structured Feedback:**action Critiquing**:- Human Observes Ai Action and Provides Feedback- Types: "good Action", "BAD Action", "better Action Would Be..."- Update Policy Based on Critique**state-action Advice**:$$\mathcal{l}*{\text{advice}} = -\log \pi(a*{\text{advised}} | S) \cdot W*{\text{confidence}}$$### Demonstration and Intervention**human Demonstrations**:- Collect Expert Trajectories: $\tau*{\text{expert}} = \{(S*0, A*0), (S*1, A*1), \ldots\}$- Learn Via Behavioral Cloning or Inverse Rl- Active Learning: Query Human on Uncertain States**intervention Learning**:- Human Takes Control When Ai Makes Mistakes- Learn from Intervention Patterns- Identify Failure Modes and Correction Strategies### Preference Learning and Ranking**pairwise Preferences**:show Human Two Action Sequences and Ask for Preference$$\mathcal{p} = \{(\TAU*1, \TAU*2, \text{preference})\}$$**trajectory Ranking**:rank Multiple Trajectories by PERFORMANCE$$\TAU*1 \succ \TAU*2 \succ \ldots \succ \tau*k$$**active Preference Learning**:intelligently Select Which Comparisons to Show Human:$$\text{query}^* = \arg\max*{\text{query}}

Bidirectional Communication for Coordination**multimodal Communication**:- Visual Indicators (attention, Confidence)- Gestural Input from Humans- Audio Feedback and Alerts### Coordination Strategies**task Allocation**:divide Tasks Based on Comparative Advantage:$$\text{assign}(t*i) = \begin{cases}\text{human} & \text{if } \text{advantage}*{\text{human}}(t*i) > \text{advantage}*{\text{ai}}(t*i) \\\text{ai} & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$**dynamic Role Assignment**:roles Change Based on Context, Performance, and Availability:- **leader-follower**: One Party Leads, Other Assists- **peer Collaboration**: Equal Partnership with Negotiation- **hierarchical**: Clear Command Structure with Delegation## 3.4 Advanced Collaborative Learning Paradigms### Constitutional Aitrain Ai Systems to Follow High-level PRINCIPLES:1. **constitutional Training**: Define Principles in Natural LANGUAGE2. **self-critiquing**: Ai Evaluates Its Own Responses against PRINCIPLES3. **iterative Refinement**: Improve Responses Based on Principle Violations**constitutional Loss**:$$\mathcal{l}*{\text{constitutional}} = \mathcal{l}*{\text{task}} + \lambda \sum*i \text{violation}(\text{principle}*i)$$### Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning (co-irl)learn Shared Reward Functions through Interaction:$$r^* = \arg\max*r \LOG P(\tau*{\text{human}} | R) + \LOG P(\tau_{\text{ai}} | R) + \text{cooperation}(r)$$### Multi-agent Human-ai Teamsextend Collaboration to Multi-agent Settings:**team Formation**:- Optimal Team Composition (humans + Ai Agents)- Role

Concept Translates to Training Massive Models on Diverse Experiences That Can Then Be Fine-tuned for Specific Tasks.## 1.1 Theoretical Foundations### Decision Transformersthe Decision Transformer Reframes Rl as a Sequence Modeling Problem, Where the Goal Is to Generate Actions Conditioned on Desired Returns.**key Insight**: Instead of Learning Value Functions or Policy Gradients, We Model:$$p(a*t | S*{1:T}, A*{1:T-1}, R*{t:t})$$where $r*{t:t}$ Represents the Desired Return-to-go from Time $T$ to Episode End $T$.### Trajectory Transformersextend Transformers to Model Entire Trajectories:$$p(\tau | G) = \PROD*{T=0}^{T} P(S*{T+1}, R*t, A*t | S*{1:T}, A*{1:T-1}, G)$$where $G$ Represents the Goal or Task Specification.### Multi-task Pre-trainingfoundation Models in Rl Are Trained on Massive Datasets Containing:- Multiple Environments and Tasks- Diverse Behavioral Policies- Various Skill Demonstrations- Cross-modal Experiences (vision, Language, Control)**training Objective**:$$\mathcal{l} = \sum*{\mathcal{d}*i} \mathbb{e}*{\tau \SIM \mathcal{d}*i} [-\log P(\tau | \text{context}*i)]$$### In-context Learning for Rlsimilar to Language Models, Rl Foundation Models Can Adapt to New Tasks through In-context Learning:- Provide Few-shot Demonstrations- Model Infers Task Structure and Optimal Behavior- No Gradient Updates Required## 1.2 Advantages and Challenges### ADVANTAGES:1. **sample Efficiency**: Leverage Pre-training for Rapid ADAPTATION2. **generalization**: Transfer Knowledge Across Diverse TASKS3. **few-shot Learning**: Adapt to New Tasks with Minimal

High-quality Training DATA3. **task Distribution**: Performance Depends on Training Task DIVERSITY4. **fine-tuning Complexity**: Avoiding Catastrophic Forgetting during Adaptation### Scaling Laws in Rlsimilar to Language Models, Rl Foundation Models Exhibit Scaling Laws:- **model Size**: Larger Models Achieve Better Performance- **data Scale**: More Diverse Training Data Improves Generalization-

# Abhishek Gupta

### About

Abhishek Gupta is an Assistant Professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, where he leads the Washington Embodied Intelligence and Robotics Development (WEIRD) Lab. His research focuses on enabling robotic systems to learn complex tasks in unstructured, human-centric environments such as homes and offices. Gupta works on real-world reinforcement learning with themes like deployment-time adaptation, human-in-the-loop learning, and leveraging off-domain data from videos, simulations, and generative models. He earned his Ph.D. in machine learning and robotics at UC Berkeley, advised by Sergey Levine and Pieter Abbeel, and later held a postdoctoral position at MIT, collaborating with Russ Tedrake and Pulkit Agrawal. His broader research interests include offline RL, dexterous manipulation, meta-learning, safe and scalable adaptation, and the development of foundation models for embodied AI.

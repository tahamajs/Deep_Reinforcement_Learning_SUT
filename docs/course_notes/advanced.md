# Week 4: Advanced Methods


## Introduction

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has significantly evolved with the development of **actor-critic methods**, which combine the benefits of policy-based and value-based approaches. These methods utilize **policy gradients** for optimizing the agentâ€™s actions while employing a **critic network** to estimate value functions, leading to improved stability.

As we explored last week, key concepts like Reward-to-Go and Advantage Estimation lay the foundation for understanding and enhancing these methods. Building on that conversation, this document revisits these ideas, emphasizing their role in refining policy updates and stabilizing training.

In actor-critic methods, we explore key concepts that enhance learning efficiency:

- **Reward-to-Go**: A method for computing future. 
- **Advantage Estimation**: A technique to quantify how much better an action is compared to the expected return.  
- **Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)**: A framework that balances bias and variance in advantage computation, making training more stable.  

This document covers three widely used actor-critic algorithms:

- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: A popular on-policy algorithm that stabilizes policy updates through a clipped objective function.  
- **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)**: An off-policy algorithm designed for continuous action spaces, incorporating experience replay and target networks.  
- **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)**: A state-of-the-art off-policy method that introduces entropy maximization to improve exploration and robustness.  

Each section delves into these algorithms, their theoretical foundations, and their practical advantages in reinforcement learning tasks.

#### Actor-Critic

The variance of policy methods can originate from two sources:

1. high variance in the cumulative reward estimate
2. high variance in the gradient estimate. 

For both problems, a solution has been developed: bootstrapping for better reward estimates and baseline subtraction to lower the variance of gradient estimates.

In the next seciton we will review the concepts bootstrapping (***reward to go***), using baseline (***Advantage value***) and ***Generalized Advantage Estimation*** (GAE).

##### Reward to Go:
***A cumulative reward from state $s_t$ to the end of the episode by applying policy $\pi_\theta$.***

As mentioned earlier, in the *policy gradient* method, we update our policy weights with the learning rate $\alpha$ as follows:

$$
\theta \leftarrow \theta + \alpha \nabla_\theta J(\theta),
$$

where

$$
\nabla_\theta J(\theta) \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum^N_{i=1} \sum^T_{t=1} \nabla_\theta \log\pi_\theta(a_{i,t}|s_{i,t})\cdot r(s_{i,t},a_{i,t}).
$$

In this equation, the term $r(s_{i,t}, a_{i,t})$ is the primary source of variance and noise. We use the *causality trick* to mitigate this issue by multiplying the policy gradient at state $s_t$ with its future rewards. It is important to note that the policy at state $s_t$ can only affect future rewards, not past ones. The causality trick is represented as follows:

$$
\nabla_\theta J(\theta) \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum^N_{i=1}\bigg( \sum^T_{t=1} \nabla_\theta \log\pi_\theta(a_{i,t}|s_{i,t})\bigg) \bigg( \sum^T_{t=1}r(s_{i,t},a_{i,t}) \bigg) \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum^N_{i=1} \sum^T_{t=1} \nabla_\theta \log\pi_\theta(a_{i,t}|s_{i,t})\bigg( \sum^T_{t'=t}r(s_{i,t'},a_{i,t'}) \bigg).
$$

The term $\sum^T_{t'=t}r(s_{i,t'},a_{i,t'})$ is known as ***reward to go***, which is calculated in a Monte Carlo manner. It represents the total expected reward from a given state by applying policy $\pi_\theta$, starting from time $t$ to the end of the episode.

To further reduce variance, we can approximate the *reward to go* with the *Q-value*, which conveys a similar meaning. Thus, we can rewrite $\nabla_\theta J(\theta)$ as:

$$
\nabla_\theta J(\theta) \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum^N_{i=1} \sum^T_{t=1} \nabla_\theta \log\pi_\theta(a_{i,t}|s_{i,t}) Q(s_{i,t},a_{i,t}).
$$

##### Advantage Value:
***Measures how much an action is better than the average of other actions in a given state.***

    alt="Advantage value"
    style="float: center; margin-right: 10px;" 
    /> 
    </center>

###### Why Use the Advantage Value?
We can further reduce variance by subtracting a baseline from $Q(s_{i,t}, a_{i,t})$ without altering the expectation of $\nabla_\theta J(\theta)$, making it an unbiased estimator:

$$
\nabla_\theta J(\theta) \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum^N_{i=1} \sum^T_{t=1} \nabla_\theta \log\pi_\theta(a_{i,t}|s_{i,t}) \bigg( Q(s_{i,t},a_{i,t}) - b_t \bigg).
$$

A reasonable choice for the baseline is the expected reward. Although it is not optimal, it significantly reduces variance.

We define:

$$
Q(s_{i,t},a_{i,t}) = \sum_{t'=t}^T E_{\pi_\theta}[r(s_{t'}, a_{t'})|s_t,a_t].
$$

To ensure the baseline is independent of the action taken, we compute the expectation of $Q(s_{i,t}, a_{i,t})$ over all actions sampled from the policy:

$$
E_{a_t \sim \pi_\theta(a_{i,t}|s_{i,t})} [Q(s_{i,t},a_{i,t})] = V(s_t) = b_t.
$$

Thus, the variance-reduced policy gradient equation becomes:

$$
\nabla_\theta J(\theta) \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum^N_{i=1} \sum^T_{t=1} \nabla_\theta \log\pi_\theta(a_{i,t}|s_{i,t}) \bigg( Q(s_{i,t},a_{i,t}) - V(s_t) \bigg).
$$

We define the *advantage function* as:

$$
A(s_t,a_t) = Q(s_{i,t},a_{i,t}) - V(s_t).
$$



!!! example "Example of Understanding the Advantage Function"

    Consider a penalty shootout game to illustrate the concept of the advantage function and Q-values in reinforcement learning.


    <center> 
    <img src="\assets\images\course_notes\advanced\Football.png"
        alt="penalty shootout game"
        style="float: center; margin-right: 10px;" 
        /> 
        </center>

    - **Game Setup**:
        1. *Goalie Strategy*:  A goalie always jumps to the right to block the shot.
        2. *Kicker Strategy*: A kicker can shoot either left or right with equal probability (0.5 each), defining the kicker's policy $\pi_k$.


    The reward matrix for the game is:

    | Kicker / Goalie | Right (jumps right) | Left (jumps left) |
    |:---:|:---:|:---:|
    | Right (shoots right)  | 0,1  | 1,0  |
    | Left (shoots left)    | 1,0  | 0,1  |

    - **Expected Reward**:
  
        Since the kicker selects left and right with equal probability, the expected reward is:

        $$
        V^{\pi_k}(s_t) = 0.5 \times 1 + 0.5 \times 0 = 0.5.
        $$

    - **Q-Value Calculation**:
        The Q-value is expressed as:

        $$
        Q^{\pi_k}(s_{i,t},a_{i,t}) = V^{\pi_k}(s_t) + A^{\pi_k}(s_t,a_t).
        $$

        - If the kicker shoots right, the shot is always saved ($Q^{\pi_k}(s_{i,t},r) = 0$).
        - If the kicker shoots left, the shot is always successful ($Q^{\pi_k}(s_{i,t},l) = 1$).

    - **Advantage Calculation**:

        The advantage function $A^{\pi_k}(s_t,a_t)$ measures how much better or worse an action is compared to the expected reward.

        - If the kicker shoots left, he scores (reward = 1), which is 0.5 more than the expected reward $V^{\pi_k}(s_t)$. Thus, the advantage of shooting left is:

        $$
        1 = 0.5 + A^{\pi_k}(s_t,l) \Rightarrow A^{\pi_k}(s_t,l) = 0.5.
        $$

        - If the kicker shoots right, he fails (reward = 0), which is 0.5 less than the expected reward. Thus, the advantage of shooting right is:

        $$
        0 = 0.5 + A^{\pi_k}(s_t,r) \Rightarrow A^{\pi_k}(s_t,r) = -0.5.
        $$

###### Estimating the Advantage Value

Instead of maintaining separate networks for estimating $V(s_t)$ and $Q(s_{i,t}, a_{i,t})$, we approximate $Q(s_{i,t}, a_{i,t})$ using $V(s_t)$:

$$
Q(s_{i,t},a_{i,t}) = r(s_t, a_t) + \sum_{t'=t+1}^T E_{\pi_\theta}[r(s_{t'}, a_{t'})|s_t,a_t] \approx r(s_t, a_t) + V(s_{t+1}).
$$

Thus, we estimate the advantage function as:

$$
A(s_{i,t},a_{i,t}) \approx r(s_t, a_t) + V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t).
$$

We can also, consider the advantage function with discount factor as:

$$
A(s_{i,t},a_{i,t}) \approx r(s_t, a_t) + \gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t).
$$

To train the value estimator, we use Monte Carlo estimation.

##### Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)
To have a good  balance between variance and bias, we can use the concept of GAE, which is firstly introduced in [High-Dimensional Continuous Control Using Generalized Advantage Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02438). 

At the first, we define $\hat{A}^{(k)}(s_{i,t},a_{i,t})$ to understand this the GAE concept.

$$
\hat{A}^{(k)}(s_{i,t},a_{i,t}) = r(s_t, a_t) + \dots + \gamma^{k-1}r(s_{t+k-1}, a_{t+k-1}) + \gamma^k V(s_{t+k})- V(s_t).
$$

So, we can write the $\hat{A}^{(k)}(s_{i,t},a_{i,t})$ for $k \in \{1, \infty\}$ as:


$$
\hat{A}^{(1)}(s_{i,t},a_{i,t}) = r(s_t, a_t) + \gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)
$$

$$
\hat{A}^{(2)}(s_{i,t},a_{i,t}) = r(s_t, a_t) + \gamma r(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) + \gamma^2 V(s_{t+2}) - V(s_t)
$$

$$
.\\
.\\
.\\
$$

$$
\hat{A}^{(\infty)}(s_{i,t},a_{i,t}) = r(s_t, a_t) + \gamma r(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) + \gamma^2 r(s_{t+2}, a_{t+2})+ \dots - V(s_t)\\
$$

$\hat{A}^{(1)}(s_{i,t},a_{i,t})$ is high bias, low variance, whilst $\hat{A}^{(\infty)}(s_{i,t},a_{i,t})$ is unbiased, high variance.

We take a weighted average of all $\hat{A}^{(k)}(s_{i,t},a_{i,t})$ for $k \in \{1, \infty\}$ with weight $w_k = \lambda^{k-1}$ to balance bias and variance. This is called Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE). 

$$
\hat{A}^{(GAE)}(s_{i,t},a_{i,t}) = \frac{\sum_{k =1}^T  w_k \hat{A}^{(k)}(s_{i,t},a_{i,t})}{\sum_k w_k}= \frac{\sum_{k =1}^T \lambda^{k-1} \hat{A}^{(k)}(s_{i,t},a_{i,t})}{\sum_k w_k}
$$


##### Actor-Critic Algorihtms

###### Batch actor-critic algorithm
The first algorithm is *Actor-Critic with Bootstrapping and Baseline Subtraction*.
In this algorithm, the simulator runs for an entire episode before updating the policy.

**Batch actor-critic algorithm:**

1. **for** each episode **do**:
2. &emsp;**for** each step **do**:
3. &emsp;&emsp;Take action $a_t \sim \pi_{\theta}(a_t | s_t)$, get $(s_t,a_t,s'_t,r_t)$.
4. &emsp;Fit $\hat{V}(s_t)$ with sampled rewards.
5. &emsp;Evaluate the advantage function: $A({s_t, a_t})$
6. &emsp;Compute the policy gradient: $\nabla_{\theta} J(\theta) \approx \sum_{i} \nabla_{\theta} \log \pi_{\theta}(a_i | s_i) A({s_t})$
7. &emsp;Update the policy parameters:  $\theta \gets \theta + \alpha \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta)$
 


Running full episodes for a single update is inefficient as it requires a significant amount of time. To address this issue, the **online actor-critic algorithm** is proposed.

###### Online actor-critic algorithm


In this algorithm, we take an action in the environment and immediately apply an update using that action.

**Online actor-critic algorithm**

1. **for** each episode **do**:
2. &emsp;**for** each step **do**:
3. &emsp;&emsp;Take action $a_t \sim \pi_{\theta}(a_t | s_t)$, get $(s_t,a_t,s'_t,r_t)$.
2. &emsp;&emsp;Fit $\hat{V}(s_t)$ with the sampled reward.
3. &emsp;&emsp;Evaluate the advantage function: $A({s,a})$
4. &emsp;&emsp;Compute the policy gradient: $\nabla_{\theta} J(\theta) \approx  \nabla_{\theta} \log \pi_{\theta}(a | s) A({s,a})$
5. &emsp;&emsp;Update the policy parameters: $\theta \gets \theta + \alpha \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta)$

Training neural networks with a batch size of 1 leads to high variance, making the training process unstable.

To mitigate this issue, two main solutions are commonly used:

1. **Parallel Actor-Critic (Online)**
2. **Off-Policy Actor-Critic**


###### Parallel Actor-Critic (Online)
Many high-performance implementations are based on the actor critic approach. For large problems, the algorithm is typically parallelized and implemented on a large cluster computer.

<center> 
<img src="\assets\images\course_notes\advanced\Parallel.jpg"
    alt="Parallel Actor-Critic framework"
    style="float: center; margin-right: 10px;" 
    /> 
    </center>

To reduce variance, multiple actors are used to update the policy. There are two main approaches:


- **Synchronized Parallel Actor-Critic:** All actors run synchronously, and updates are applied simultaneously. However, this introduces synchronization overhead, making it impractical in many cases.
- **Asynchronous Parallel Actor-Critic:** Each actor applies its updates independently, reducing synchronization constraints and improving computational efficiency. It also, uses asynchronous (parallel and distributed) gradient descent for optimization of deep neural network controllers.

    [The idea behind Actor-Critics and how A2C and A3C improve them](https://theaisummer.com/Actor_critics/)


###### Off-Policy Actor-Critic Algorithm

In the off-policy approach, we maintain a replay buffer to store past experiences, allowing us to train the model using previously collected data rather than relying solely on the most recent experience.


<center> 
<img src="\assets\images\course_notes\advanced\offpolicy.png"
    alt="Replay buffer"
    style="float: center; margin-right: 10px;" 
    /> 
    </center>

**Off-policy actor-critic algorithm:**

1. **for** each episode **do**:
2. &emsp;**for** multiple steps **do**:
3. &emsp;&emsp;Take action $a \sim \pi_{\theta}(a | s)$, get $(s,a,s',r)$, store in $\mathcal{R}$.
4. &emsp;Sample a batch $\{s_i, a_i, r_i, s'_i \}$ for buffer $\mathcal{R}$.
5. &emsp;Fit $\hat{Q}^{\pi}(s_i, a_i)$ for each $s_i, a_i$.
6. &emsp;Compute the policy gradient: $\nabla_{\theta} J(\theta) \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i} \nabla_{\theta} \log \pi_{\theta}(a^{\pi}_i | s_i) \hat{Q}^{\pi}(s_i, a^{\pi}_i)$
7. &emsp;Update the policy parameters: $\theta \gets \theta + \alpha \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta)$

To work with off-policy methods, we use the Q-value instead of the V-value in step 3. In step 4, rather than using the advantage function, we directly use $\hat{Q}^{\pi}(s_i, a^{\pi}_i)$, where $a^{\pi}_i$  is sampled from the policy $\pi$. By using the Q-value instead of the advantage function, we do not encounter the high-variance problem typically associated with single-step updates. This is because we sample a batch from the replay buffer, which inherently reduces variance. As a result, there is no need to compute an explicit advantage function for variance reduction.


##### Issues with Standard Policy Gradient Methods
Earlier policy gradient methods, such as Vanilla Policy Gradient (VPG) or REINFORCE, suffer from high variance and instability in training. A key problem is that large updates to the policy can lead to drastic performance degradation.

To address these issues, Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) was introduced, enforcing a constraint on how much the policy can change in a single update. However, TRPO is computationally expensive because it requires solving a constrained optimization problem.
PPO is a simpler and more efficient alternative to TRPO, designed to ensure stable policy updates without requiring complex constraints.

---
#### Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

##### How PPO Enhances On-Policy Actor-Critic Methods

**PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)** is an on-policy actor-critic algorithm. It combines a policy network (the actor) and a value network (the critic) and employs a clipped surrogate objective to restrict excessive policy updates, thereby promoting training stability.

PPO addresses several problems inherent in on-policy actor-critic methods in the following ways:

- **Stabilizing Policy Updates:**  
  PPO introduces a *clipping mechanism* in its objective function that constrains the policy update by ensuring the new policy doesn't deviate too far from the old policy.This clipping prevents overly large updates, thereby stabilizing the learning process and reducing sensitivity.

- **Improving Sample Efficiency:**  
  Although PPO is an on-policy algorithm, it reuses a fixed batch of data for multiple epochs of mini-batch updates. This means that each set of interactions with the environment can contribute more to learning, mitigating the need for excessive sampling.

- **Reducing Variance in Gradient Estimates:**  
  By incorporating advanced advantage estimation techniques (e.g., Generalized Advantage Estimation), PPO reduces the high variance typically associated with policy gradients, leading to more reliable and stable updates.

- **Implicitly Maintaining a Trust Region:**  
  The clipping mechanism acts like an implicit trust region constraint. It ensures that updates remain within a safe boundary around the current policy, which helps in achieving monotonic improvements and prevents performance collapse.


##### The intuition behind PPO
The idea with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is that we want to improve the training stability of the policy by limiting the change you make to the policy at each training epoch: **we want to avoid having too large policy updates**.  why?

1. We know empirically that smaller policy updates during training are more likely to converge to an optimal solution.
2. If we change the policy too much, we may end up with a bad policy that cannot be improved.

*soruce: [Unit 8, of the Deep Reinforcement Learning Class with Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/blog/deep-rl-ppo)*

Therefore, in order not to allow the current policy to change much compared to the previous policy, we limit the ratio of these two policies to  $[1 - \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon]$.

##### the Clipped Surrogate Objective 

$$
L^{CLIP}(\theta) = \hat{\mathbb{E}}_t \left[ \min \left( r_t(\theta) \hat{A}_t, \text{clip} \left( r_t(\theta), 1 - \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon \right) \hat{A}_t \right) \right]
$$

###### *The ratio Function*

$$
r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_{\theta}(a_t | s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a_t | s_t)}
$$

$r_{\theta}$ denotes the probability ratio between the current and old policy. if $r_{\theta} > 1$, then the probability of doing action $a_t$ at $s_t$ in current policy is higher than the old policy and vice versa.

So this probability ratio is an easy way to estimate the divergence between old and current policy.


###### *The clipped part*

$$
\text{clip} \left( r_t(\theta), 1 - \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon \right) \hat{A}_t
$$

If the current policy is updated significantly, such that the new policy parameters $\theta'$  diverge greatly from the previous ones, the probability ratio between the new and old policies is clipped to the bounds 
$1 - \epsilon$, $1 + \epsilon$. At this point, the derivative of the objective function becomes zero, effectively preventing further updates. 


###### *The unclipped part*
$$
r_t(\theta) \hat{A}_t
$$

In the context of optimization, if the initial starting point is not idealâ€”i.e., if the probability ratio between the new and old policies is outside the range of $1 - \epsilon$ and $1 + \epsilon$â€”the ratio is clipped to these bounds. This clipping results in the derivative of the objective function becoming zero, meaning no gradient is available for updates. 

In this formulation, the optimization is performed with respect to the new policy parameters $\theta'$, and $A$ represents the advantage function, which indicates how much better or worse the action performed is compared to the average return.


!!! example "Example of PPO objective function"

    - Case 1: **Positive Advantage ($A > 0$)**

    if the Advantage $A$ is positive (indicating that the action taken has a higher return than the expected return), and $\frac{\pi_{\theta}(a_t | s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a_t | s_t)} < 1-\epsilon$ , the unclipped part is less than the clipped part and then it is minimized, so we have gradient to update the policy. This allows the policy to increase the probability of the action, aiming for the ratio to reach $1 + \epsilon$ without violating the clipping constraint.

    
    - Case 2: **Negative Advantage ($A < 0$)**

    On the other hand, if the Advantage $A$ is negative (meaning the action taken is worse than the average return), and $\frac{\pi_{\theta}(a_t | s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a_t | s_t)} > 1+\epsilon$, the unclipped objective is again minimized and the gradient is non-zero, leading to an update. In this case, since the Advantage is negative, the policy is adjusted to reduce the probability of selecting that action, bringing the ratio closer to the boundary ($1-\epsilon$), while ensuring that the new policy does not deviate too much from the old one.

    $$

8. **end for**



##### Challenges of PPO algorithm
 PPO requires a significant amount of interactions with the environment to converge. This can be problematic in real-world applications where data is expensive or difficult to collect. In fact it is a sample inefficient algorithm.

1. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: 
 PPO requires careful tuning of hyperparameters such as the clipping parameter (epsilon), learning rate, and the number of updates per iteration. Poorly chosen hyperparameters can lead to suboptimal performance or even failure to converge.

2. **Sample Efficiency**: Although PPO is more sample-efficient than some other policy gradient methods, it still requires a significant amount of data to achieve good performance. This can be problematic in environments where data collection is expensive or time-consuming.

3. **Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff**: PPO, like other policy gradient methods, can struggle with balancing exploration and exploitation. It may prematurely converge to suboptimal policies if it fails to explore sufficiently.

#### Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG)

##### Handling Continuous Action Spaces

###### Why is this a problem?
In discrete action spaces, methods like **DQN (Deep Q-Networks)** can use an action-value function $Q(s, a)$ to select the best action. However, in continuous action spaces, selecting the optimal action requires solving a high-dimensional optimization problem at every step, which is computationally expensive.

###### How does DDPG solve it?
DDPG uses a deterministic policy network $\pi(s)$, which directly maps states to actions, eliminating the need for iterative optimization over action values.

##### DDPG Architecture

DDPG uses four neural networks:

   - A **Q network**  
   - A **deterministic policy network**  
   - A **target Q network**  
   - A **target policy network**  

The Q network and policy network are similar to Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), but in DDPG, the **Actor directly maps states to actions** (the output of the network directly represents the action) instead of outputting a probability distribution over a discrete action space.

The **target networks** are time-delayed copies of their original networks that **slowly track the learned networks**. Using these target value networks greatly improves stability in learning.  

###### Why Use Target Networks?
In methods without target networks, the update equations of the network depend on the network's own calculated values, making it **prone to divergence**.  

For example, if we update the Q-values directly using the current network, errors can compound, leading to instability. The target networks help mitigate this issue by **providing more stable targets** for updates. 

$$
    Q(s_t, a_t) \leftarrow r_t + \gamma Q(s_{t+1}, \arg\max_{a'} Q(s_{t+1}, a'))
$$



##### Breakdown of DDPG Components  

1. **Experience Replay**  
2. **Actor & Critic Network Updates**  
3. **Target Network Updates**  
4. **Exploration**  


###### **Replay Buffer** 

As used in **Deep Q-Learning** and other RL algorithms, DDPG also utilizes a **replay buffer** to store experience tuples:  

$$
(state, action, reward, next\_state)
$$

These tuples are stored in a **finite-sized cache** (replay buffer). During training, **random mini-batches** are sampled from this buffer to update the value and policy networks.

???+ note "Why Use Experience Replay?"

    In optimization tasks, we want **data to be independently distributed**. However, in an **on-policy** learning process, the collected data is highly correlated.  

    By storing experience in a **replay buffer** and sampling random mini-batches for training, we break correlations and improve learning stability.


###### **Actor (Policy) & Critic (Value) Network Updates**  

The value network is updated similarly to Q-learning. The updated Q-value is obtained using the Bellman equation:

$$
y_i = r_i + \gamma Q' \left (s_{i+1}, \mu' (s_{i+1}|\theta^{\mu'})|\theta^{Q'} \right)
$$

However, in DDPG, the next-state Q-values are calculated using the target Q network and target policy network.  

Then, we minimize the mean squared error (MSE) loss between the updated Q-value and the original Q-value:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i} \left(y_i -Q(s_i, a_i|\theta^Q) \right)^2
$$

- *Note: The original Q-value is calculated using the learned Q-network, not the target Q-network.*

The policy function aims to maximize the expected return:

$$
J(\theta) = \mathbb{E} \left[ Q(s, a) \mid s = s_t, a_t = \mu(s_t) \right]
$$

The **policy loss** is computed by differentiating the objective function with respect to the policy parameters:

$$
\nabla_{\theta^\mu} J(\theta) = \nabla_a Q(s, a) |_{a = \mu(s)} \nabla_{\theta^\mu} \mu(s|\theta^\mu)
$$

But since we are updating the policy in an off-policy way with batches of experience, we take the mean of the sum of gradients calculated from the mini-batch:


$$
\nabla_{\theta_\mu} J(\theta) \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_i \left[ 
\left. \nabla_a Q(s, a \mid \theta^Q) \right|_{s = s_i, a = \mu(s_i)} 
\nabla_{\theta_\mu} \mu(s \mid \theta^\mu) \Big|_{s = s_i} 
\right]
$$

###### **Target Network Updates**  

The **target networks** are updated via **soft updates** instead of direct copying:

$$
\theta^{Q'} \leftarrow \tau \theta^{Q} + (1 - \tau) \theta^{Q'}
$$

$$
\theta^{\mu'} \leftarrow \tau \theta^{\mu} + (1 - \tau) \theta^{\mu'}
$$

where $\tau$ is a small value , ensuring smooth updates that prevent instability.


###### **Exploration**  

In RL for discrete action spaces, exploration is often done using epsilon-greedy or Boltzmann exploration.  

However, in continuous action spaces, exploration is done by adding noise to the action itself.  

- Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process  
The DDPG paper proposes adding **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noise** to the actions.  

The **OU Process** generates **temporally correlated noise**, preventing the noise from canceling out or "freezing" the action dynamics.



$$
\mu^{'}(s_t) = \mu(s_t|\theta^\mu_t) + \mathcal{N}
$$

#### Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) 

##### Challenges and motivation of SAC
1. Previous Off-policy methods like DDPG often struggle with exploration , leading to suboptimal policies. SAC overcomes this by introducing entropy maximization, which encourages the agent to explore more efficiently.
2. Sample inefficiency is a major issue in on-policy algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which require a large number of interactions with the environment. SAC, being an off-policy algorithm, reuses past experiences stored in a replay buffer, making it significantly more sample-efficient.
3. Another challenge is instability in learning, as methods like DDPG can suffer from overestimation of Q-values. SAC mitigates this by employing twin Q-functions (similar to TD3) and incorporating entropy regularization, leading to more stable and robust learning.

In essence, SAC seeks to maximize the entropy in policy, in addition to the expected reward from the environment. The entropy in policy can be interpreted as randomness in the policy.

???+ note "what is entropy?"

    We can think of entropy as how unpredictable a random variable is. If a random variable always takes a single value then it has zero entropy because itâ€™s not unpredictable at all. If a random variable can be any Real Number with equal probability then it has very high entropy as it is very unpredictable.

        style="float: center; margin-right: 10px;" 
        /> 
        </center>


    *probability distributions with low entropy have a tendency to greedily sample certain values, as the probability mass is distributed relatively unevenly*.


##### Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning

In Maximum Entropy RL, the agent tries to optimize the policy to choose the right action that can receive the highest sum of reward and long term sum of entropy. This enables the agent to explore more and avoid converging to local optima.

!!! note "reason"

    We want a high entropy in our policy to encourage the policy to assign equal probabilities to actions that have same or nearly equal Q-values(allow the policy to capture multiple modes of good policies), and also to ensure that it does not collapse into repeatedly selecting a particular action that could exploit some inconsistency in the approximated Q function. Therefore, SAC overcomes the  problem by encouraging the policy network to explore and not assign a very high probability to any one part of the range of actions.

The objective function of the Maximum entropy RL is as shown below:

$$
J(\pi_{\theta}) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi_{\theta}} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t R(s_t, a_t) + \alpha H(\pi(\cdot | s_t)) \right]
$$

and the optimal policy is:

$$
\pi^* = \arg\max_{\pi_{\theta}} \mathbb{E}_{\pi_{\theta}} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t R(s_t, a_t) + \alpha H(\pi(\cdot | s_t)) \right]
$$


**$\alpha$** is the temperature parameter that balances between exploration and exploitation.


##### Overcoming Exploration Bias in Multimodal Q-Functions

Here we want to explain the concept of a **multimodal Q-function** in reinforcement learning (RL), where the **Q-value function**, $Q(s, a)$, represents the expected cumulative reward for taking action $a$ in state $s$. 

In this context, the robot is in an initial state and has two possible passages to follow, which result in a **bimodal Q-function** (a function with two peaks). These peaks correspond to two different action choices, each leading to different potential outcomes.


###### **Standard RL Approach**

<center> 
<img src="\assets\images\course_notes\advanced\SAC1.png"
    alt="sac1"
    style="float: center; margin-right: 10px;" 
    /> 
    </center>


The **grey curve** represents the Q-function, which has two peaks, indicating two promising actions.A conventional RL approach typically assumes a unimodal (single-peaked) policy distribution, represented by the **red curve**.

This policy distribution is modeled as a Gaussian $\mathcal{N}(\mu(s_t), \Sigma)$ centered around the highest Q-value peak.

This setup results in exploration bias where the agent primarily explores around the highest peak and ignores the lower peak entirely.


###### **Improved Exploration Strategy**
Instead of using a unimodal Gaussian policy, a Boltzmann-weighted policy is used.
The **policy distribution (green shaded area)** is proportional to $\exp(Q(s_t, a_t))$, meaning actions are sampled based on their Q-values. 

This approach allows the agent to explore multiple high-reward actions and avoids the bias of ignoring one passage.
As a result, the agent recognizes both options, increasing the chance of finding the optimal path.

    </center>


This concept is relevant for **actor-critic RL methods** like **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)**, which uses entropy to encourage diverse exploration.
 

##### Soft Policy
- Soft policy 

$$
J(\pi) = \sum_{t=0}^{T} \mathbb{E}_{(s_t, a_t)\sim\rho_{\pi}} \left[ r(s_t, a_t) + \alpha\mathcal{H}(\pi(\cdot | s_t)) \right]
$$

With new objective function we need to define Value funciton and Q-value funciton again. 


- Soft Q-value funciton

$$
Q(s_t, a_t) = r(s_t, a_t) + \gamma\mathbb{E}_{s_{t+1}\sim p}\left[ V(s_{t+1}) \right]
$$

- Soft Value function

$$
V(s_t) = \mathbb{E}_{a_t\sim \pi} \left[Q(s_t, a_t) - \text{log}\space\pi(a_t|s_t)\right]
$$

##### Soft Policy Iteration
Soft Policy Iteration is an entropy-regularized version of classical policy iteration, which consists of:

1. *Soft Policy Evaluation*: Estimating the soft Q-value function under the current policy.
2. *Soft Policy Improvement*:  Updating the policy to maximize the soft Q-value function,incorporating entropy regularization.

This process iteratively improves the policy while balancing exploration and exploitation.

###### Soft Policy Evaluation (Critic Update)
The goal of soft policy evaluation is to compute the expected return of a given policy $\pi$ under the maximum entropy objective, which modifies the standard Bellman equation by adding an entropy term. (SAC explicitly learns the Q-function for the current policy)

The soft Q-value function for a policy $\pi$ is updated using a modified Bellman operator $T^{\pi}$:

$$
T^\pi Q(s_t, a_t) = r(s_t, a_t) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{s_{t+1} \sim p} [V(s_{t+1})]
$$

with substitution of $V$ we have :

$$
T^\pi Q(s_t, a_t) = r(s_t, a_t) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{\substack{s_{t+1} \sim p \\ a_{t+1} \sim \pi}} [Q(s_{t+1,}, a_{t+1}) - \text{log}\space\pi(a_{t+1}|s_{t+1})]
$$

**Key Result: Soft Bellman Backup Convergence**  

**Theorem:** By repeatedly applying the operator $T^\pi$, the Q-value function converges to the true soft Q-value function for policy $\pi$:  

$$
Q_k \to Q^\pi \text{ as } k \to \infty
$$

Thus, we can estimate $Q^\pi$ iteratively.

###### Soft Policy Improvement (Actor Update)
Once the Q-function is learned, we need to improve the policy using a gradient-based update. This means:

- Instead of directly maximizing Q-values, the policy is updated to optimize a modified objective that balances reward maximization and exploration.
- The update is off-policy, meaning the policy can be trained using past experiences stored in a replay buffer, rather than requiring fresh samples like on-policy methods (e.g., PPO).

The update is based on an ***exponential function of the Q-values***:

$$
\pi^*(a | s) \propto \exp (Q^\pi(s, a))
$$

which means the optimal policy is obtained by normalizing $\exp (Q^\pi(s, a))$ over all actions:

$$
\pi^*(a | s) = \frac{\exp (Q^\pi(s, a))}{Z^\pi(s)}
$$

where $Z^\pi(s)$ is the partition function that ensures the distribution sums to 1.

For the policy improvement step, we update the policy distribution towards the softmax distribution for the current Q function.

$$
\pi_{\text{new}} = \arg \min_{\pi' \in \Pi} D_{\text{KL}} \left( \pi'(\cdot | s) \, \bigg|\bigg| \, \frac{\exp (Q^\pi(s, \cdot))}{Z^\pi(s)} \right)
$$


**Key Result: Soft Policy Improvement Theorem**  
The new policy $\pi_{\text{new}}$ obtained via this update improves the expected soft return:

$$
Q^{\pi_{\text{new}}}(s, a) \geq Q^{\pi_{\text{old}}}(s, a) \quad \forall (s, a)
$$

Thus, iterating this process leads to a better policy.

###### Convergence of Soft Policy Iteration
By alternating between soft policy evaluation and soft policy improvement, soft policy iteration converges to an optimal maximum entropy policy within the policy class $\Pi$:

$$
\pi^* = \arg \max_{\pi \in \Pi} \sum_t \mathbb{E}[r_t + \alpha H(\pi(\cdot | s_t))]
$$


However, this exact method is only feasible in the ***tabular setting***. For ***continuous control***, we approximate it using function approximators.


##### Soft Actor-Critic

For complex learning domains with high-dimensional and/or continuous state-action spaces, it is mostly impossible to find exact solutions for the MDP. Thus, we must leverage function approximation (i.e. neural networks) to find a practical approximation to soft policy iteration. then we use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to update parameters of these networks.

we model the value functions as expressive neural networks, and the policy as a Gaussian distribution over the action space with the mean and covariance given as neural network outputs with the current state as input.

###### **Soft Value function ($V_{\psi}(s)$)**

A separate soft value function which helps in stabilising the training process. The soft value function approximator minimizes the squared residual error as follows:

$$
J_V(\psi) = \mathbb{E}_{s_{t} \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ \frac{1}{2} \left( V_{\psi}(s_t) - \mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi_{\phi}} [Q_{\theta}(s_t, a_t) - \log \pi_{\phi}(a_t | s_t)] \right)^2 \right]
$$

It means the learning of the state-value function $V$, is done by minimizing the squared difference between the prediction of the value network and expected prediction of Q-function with the entropy of the policy, $\pi$.

  - $D$ is the distribution of previously sampled states and actions, or a replay buffer.

**Gradient Update for $V_{\psi}(s)$**

$$
\hat{\nabla}_{\psi} J_V(\psi) = \nabla_{\psi} V_{\psi}(s_t) \left( V_{\psi}(s_t) - Q_{\theta}(s_t, a_t) + \log \pi_{\phi}(a_t | s_t) \right)
$$

where the actions are sampled according to the current policy, instead of the replay buffer.

###### **Soft Q-funciton ($Q_{\theta}(s, a)$)**

We minimize the soft Q-function parameters by using the soft Bellman residual provided here:

$$
J_Q(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{(s_{t}, a_t) \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ \frac{1}{2} \left( Q_{\theta}(s_t, a_t) - \hat{Q}(s_t, a_t)\right)^2 \right]
$$

with : 

$$
\hat{Q}(s_t, a_t) = r(s_t, a_t) + \gamma \space \mathbb{E}_{s_{t+1} \sim p} [V_{\bar{\psi}}(s_{t+1})]
$$

**Gradient Update for $Q_{\theta}$**:

$$
\hat{\nabla}_\theta J_Q(\theta) = \nabla_{\theta} Q_{\theta}(s_t, a_t) \left( Q_{\theta}(s_t, a_t) - r(s_t, a_t) - \gamma V_{\bar{\psi}}(s_{t+1}) \right)
$$

A **target value function** $V_{\bar{\psi}}$ (exponentially moving average of $V_{\psi}$) is used to stabilize training.

---

???+ note "More Explanation About Target Networks"

    The use of target networks is motivated by a problem in training $V$ network. If you go back to the objective functions in the Theory section, you will find that the target for the $Q$ network training depends on the $V$ Network and the target for the $V$ Network depends on the $Q$ network (this makes sense because we are trying to enforce Bellman Consistency between the two functions). Because of this, the $V$ network has a target thatâ€™s indirectly dependent on itself which means that the $V$ networkâ€™s target depends on the same parameters we are trying to train. This makes training very unstable.


    The solution is to use a set of parameters which comes close to the parameters of the main $V$ network, but with a time delay. Thus we create a second network which lags the main network called the target network. There are two ways to go about this.


    1. **Periodic Hard Update**

        This method involves completely overwriting the target networkâ€™s parameters (**$\theta^{-}$**) with the main networkâ€™s parameters (**$\theta$**) at regular intervals (after a fixed number of steps).

        - **Purpose**:  
        The periodic hard update ensures the target network aligns closely with the main network, preventing significant divergence between them.

        - **Key Characteristics**:  
            - Sudden updates: The target network parameters are replaced entirely at specific intervals.
            - Simplicity: Easy to implement without requiring complex calculations.
            - Stability: Reduces computational overhead during training.
        
        - **Equation**: 
   
        $$
        \theta^{-} \leftarrow \theta
        $$

        - **Drawback**:  
        The abrupt change can lead to instability in learning if the main network's parameters shift significantly during training. It may result in fluctuations in performance for some environments.


    2. **Soft Update**  

        Soft updates use **Polyak averaging** (a kind of moving averaging), a method where the target networkâ€™s parameters (**$\theta^{-}$**) are updated gradually based on a weighted combination of the current main networkâ€™s parameters (**$\theta$**) and the existing target networkâ€™s parameters.

        - **Purpose**:  
        This smooth transition avoids abrupt shifts and allows the target network to slowly converge towards the main networkâ€™s parameters, promoting stability in learning.

        - **Key Characteristics**:  
            - Incremental updates: Parameters are updated gradually at each training step.
            - Flexibility: The weighting factor **$\tau$** (a small constant, e.g., 0.001) controls the speed of convergence.($\tau \ll 1$)
            - Stability: Ensures smooth transitions and minimizes sudden changes.

        - **Equation**: 
   
        $$
        \theta^{-} \leftarrow \tau \theta + (1-\tau) \theta^{-}
        $$

        - **Advantages**:  
            - Gradual updates reduce instability in learning.
            - Ideal for environments requiring smooth and stable convergence.

        - **Trade-off**:  
        Slower adaptation to the main networkâ€™s parameters compared to hard updates, but the added stability usually outweighs this drawback.

###### **Policy network ($\pi_{\phi}(a|s)$)**

The policy $\pi_{\phi}(a | s)$ is updated using the soft policy improvement step, minimizing the KL-divergence:

$$
J_{\pi}(\phi) = \mathbb{E}_{s_t \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ D_{\text{KL}} \left( \pi_{\phi}(\cdot | s_t) \bigg\| \frac{\exp(Q_{\theta}(s_t, \cdot))}{Z_{\theta}(s_t)} \right) \right]
$$

Instead of solving this directly, SAC reparameterizes the policy using:

$$
a_t = f_{\phi}(\epsilon_t; s_t)
$$

This trick is used to make sure that sampling from the policy is a differentiable process so that there are no problems in backpropagating the errors.  $\epsilon_t$ is random noise vector sampled from fixed distribution (e.g., Spherical Gaussian).


???+ note "Why Reparameterization is Needed?"

    In reinforcement learning, the policy $\pi(a | s)$ often outputs a probability distribution over actions rather than deterministic actions. The standard way to sample an action is:

    $$
    a_t \sim \pi_{\phi}(a_t | s_t)
    $$

    However, this sampling operation blocks gradient flow during backpropagation, preventing efficient training using stochastic gradient descent (SGD).

    Instead of directly sampling $a_t$ from $\pi_{\phi}(a_t | s_t)$, we transform a simple noise variable into an action:

    $$
    a_t = f_{\phi}(\epsilon_t, s_t)
    $$

    - $\epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$ is sampled from a fixed noise distribution (e.g., a Gaussian).
    - $f_{\phi}(\epsilon_t, s_t)$ is a differentiable function (often a neural network) that maps noise to an action.

    For a Gaussian policy in SAC, the action is computed as:

    $$
    a_t = \mu_{\phi}(s_t) + \sigma_{\phi}(s_t) \cdot \epsilon_t
    $$

    So instead of sampling from $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$ directly, we sample from a fixed standard normal and transform it using a differentiable function.This makes the policy differentiable, allowing gradients to flow through $\mu_{\phi}$ and $\sigma_{\phi}$.

    - **Continuous Action Generation**

    In a continuous action space soft actor-critic agent, the neural network in the actor takes the current observation and generates two outputs, one for the mean and the other for the standard deviation. To select an action, the actor randomly selects an unbounded action from this Gaussian distribution. If the soft actor-critic agent needs to generate bounded actions, the actor applies tanh and scaling operations to the action sampled from the Gaussian distribution.

    During training, the agent uses the unbounded Gaussian distribution to calculate the entropy of the policy for the given observation.

        /> 
        </center>

    - **Discrete Action Generation**

    In a discrete action space soft actor-critic agent, the actor takes the current observation and generates a categorical distribution, in which each possible action is associated with a probability. Since each action that belongs to the finite set is already assumed feasible, no bounding is needed.

    During training, the agent uses the categorical distribution to calculate the entropy of the policy for the given observation.




if we rewrite the equation we have:

$$
J_{\pi}(\phi) = \mathbb{E}_{s_t \sim \mathcal{D}, \epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}} \left[ \text{log}\space\pi_{\phi} \left(f_{\phi}(\epsilon_t; s_t) | s_t \right) - Q_{\theta}(s_t,f_{\phi}(\epsilon_t; s_t) \right]
$$

where $\pi_{\phi}$ is defined implicitly in terms of $f_{\phi}$, and we have
noted that the partition function is independent of $\phi$ and can
thus be omitted.

\hat{\nabla}_{\phi} J_{\pi}(\phi) = \nabla_{\phi} \log \pi_{\phi}(a_t | s_t) + \left( \nabla_{a_t} \log \pi_{\phi}(a_t | s_t)- \nabla_{a_t} Q_{\theta}(s_t, a_t) \right) \nabla_{\phi} f_{\phi}(\epsilon_t; s_t)
$$


!!! note "SAC main steps"


      1. **Q-function Update**:
        
        $$
        Q(s, a) \leftarrow r(s, a) + \mathbb{E}_{s' \sim p, a' \sim \pi} \left[ Q(s', a') - \log \pi(a' | s') \right].
        $$

        This update converges to $Q^\pi$, the Q-function under the current policy $\pi$.

      2. **Policy Update**:

        $$
        \pi_{\text{new}} = \arg\min_{\pi'} D_{KL} \left( \pi'(\cdot | s) \Bigg\| \frac{1}{Z} \exp Q^{\pi_{\text{old}}}(s, \cdot) \right).
        $$

        In practice, only one gradient step is taken on this objective to ensure stability.

      3. **Interaction with the Environment**:  
        Collect more data by interacting with the environment using the updated policy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$s_{t+1} \sim p(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t)$  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$\mathcal{D} \gets \mathcal{D} \cup \{(s_t, a_t, r(s_t, a_t), s_{t+1})\}$  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**end for**  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**for** each gradient step **do**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$\psi \gets \psi - \lambda \hat{\nabla}_{\psi} J_V(\psi)$  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$\theta_i \gets \theta_i - \lambda_Q \hat{\nabla}_{\theta_i} J_Q(\theta_i) \quad \text{for } i \in \{1,2\}$  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$\phi \gets \phi - \lambda_{\pi} \hat{\nabla}_{\phi} J_{\pi}(\phi)$  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$\bar{\psi} \gets \tau \psi + (1 - \tau) \bar{\psi}$

#### Conclusion  

##### **Reward-to-Go**  

Reward-to-Go computes the sum of future rewards starting from a specific timestep, ensuring that the agent optimizes actions based on expected future returns rather than full trajectory rewards.

  
$$
R_t = \sum_{k=t}^{T} \gamma^{k-t} r_k
$$ 

where $\gamma$ is the discount factor.

- **Advantages:**  
    - More efficient than using complete trajectory returns.  
    - Enhances learning by assigning appropriate importance to past actions based on their future impact.

- **Disadvantages:**  
    - Still introduces variance in training.  
    - Can be unstable if the reward structure is sparse or highly delayed.  

##### **Advantage Estimation**  

The advantage function quantifies how much better a specific action is compared to the expected return under the current policy. It is defined as:  

$$
A(s_t, a_t) = Q(s_t, a_t) - V(s_t)
$$

- **Advantages:**  
    - Reduces variance in policy gradient updates compared to directly using return estimates.  
    - Helps improve stability in training by distinguishing between good and bad actions.  

- **Disadvantages:**  
    - Requires an accurate value function estimation.  
    - Can still introduce bias if the value function is not well-trained.  

##### **Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)**  

GAE improves advantage estimation by introducing a **trade-off between bias and variance**, using an exponentially-weighted sum of temporal-difference (TD) residuals:

$$
A_t^{GAE(\lambda)} = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (\gamma \lambda)^l \delta_{t+l}
$$

where $\delta_t = r_t + \gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)$. The parameter $\lambda$ determines the trade-off:  

- **Low $\lambda$ (close to 0)** â†’ More bias, less variance (TD-learning).  
- **High $\lambda$ (close to 1)** â†’ Less bias, more variance (Monte Carlo estimation).  

- **Advantages:**  
    - Provides a tunable balance between bias and variance.  
    - Improves sample efficiency by reducing variance in advantage estimates.  

- **Disadvantages:**  
    - Requires careful tuning of $\lambda$ for optimal performance.  
    - Slightly increases computational overhead due to extra calculations.  

#### **Comparison of Reward-to-Go, Advantage Estimation, and GAE**  

| Method | Variance Reduction | Bias | Stability | Computational Cost |
|--------|------------------|------|-----------|--------------------|
| **Reward-to-Go** | Moderate | No bias | Moderate | Low |
| **Advantage Estimation** | High | Some bias | High | Moderate |
| **GAE** | Adjustable (via $\lambda$) | Adjustable | High | Higher |



##### **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**  

PPO is an **on-policy** actor-critic algorithm that improves stability by constraining policy updates with a clipped objective function. It builds upon Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) while being simpler to implement.  

- **Advantages:**  
    - Ensures stable updates by limiting drastic policy changes.  
    - Works well in large-scale reinforcement learning problems.  
    - Simple to implement compared to TRPO.  
    - Effective for environments with discrete and continuous action spaces.  

- **Disadvantages:**  
    - As an on-policy method, it requires more samples for training.  
    - Less sample-efficient than off-policy methods like DDPG and SAC.  
    - Clipping can sometimes slow down convergence if not tuned properly.  

##### **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)**  

DDPG is an **off-policy, model-free** algorithm designed for **continuous action spaces**. It extends **Deterministic Policy Gradient (DPG)** by incorporating **experience replay** and **target networks**, inspired by Deep Q-Networks (DQN).  

- **Advantages:**  
    - More sample-efficient than on-policy methods like PPO.  
    - Can handle high-dimensional continuous action spaces effectively.  
    - Uses replay buffers to break correlation in training data.  

- **Disadvantages:**  
    - Highly sensitive to hyperparameters like learning rates and noise scaling.  
    - Poor exploration due to its deterministic policy, requiring techniques like Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noise.  
    - Prone to instability due to function approximation errors in Q-learning.  

##### **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)**  

SAC is an **off-policy** algorithm that improves upon DDPG by introducing **entropy regularization**, which encourages exploration and robustness. It uses **two Q-networks (double Q-learning)** to mitigate overestimation bias and a **stochastic policy** for improved exploration.  

- **Advantages:**  
    - Better exploration due to entropy regularization.  
    - More stable than DDPG because of double Q-learning.  
    - Handles high-dimensional continuous control tasks efficiently.  
    - More sample-efficient than PPO.  

- **Disadvantages:**  
    - Higher computational cost due to multiple Q-function updates.  
    - Requires careful tuning of entropy coefficient $\alpha$.  
    - Slower than DDPG in deterministic settings where exploration is not an issue.  


#### **Comparison Table: PPO vs. DDPG vs. SAC**  

| Algorithm | Type | Sample Efficiency | Stability | Exploration |
|-----------|------|------------------|----------|------------|
| **PPO**  | On-policy | Low | High | Moderate | Large-scale RL, discrete & continuous actions |
| **DDPG** | Off-policy | High | Moderate | Weak (deterministic) | Continuous control, robotics |
| **SAC**  | Off-policy | High | High | Strong (entropy regularization) |


#### **Final Thoughts**  

Actor-critic methods such as **PPO, DDPG, and SAC** have significantly improved reinforcement learning, making it more scalable and sample-efficient.  

- **PPO** is widely used for its stability and ease of implementation but is less sample-efficient.  
- **DDPG** works well in continuous control but suffers from poor exploration and instability.  
- **SAC** improves upon DDPG by adding entropy regularization, leading to better exploration and stability.

        "\n",
        "This notebook presents a comprehensive implementation of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm [1], a state-of-the-art off-policy deep reinforcement learning method. SAC maximizes a trade-off between expected return and entropy, encouraging exploration while learning optimal policies. We implement three variants: (1) **Online SAC** with environment interaction, (2) **Offline SAC** trained on fixed datasets, and (3) **Conservative SAC** using Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) [2] for robust offline learning. Experimental validation on the CartPole-v1 environment demonstrates the effectiveness of entropy regularization and the importance of conservatism in offline settings.\n",

        "\n",
        "Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to learn optimal policies by maximizing cumulative rewards through environment interaction. Traditional RL algorithms face challenges in exploration-exploitation trade-offs and sample efficiency. Actor-critic methods combine value-based and policy-based approaches, using a critic to estimate value functions and an actor to update policies.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Abstract\n",
        "This notebook presents a complete implementation of the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm [1] for solving the CartPole-v1 control task from OpenAI Gymnasium. We provide detailed theoretical foundations, mathematical formulations, and practical implementation of key reinforcement learning concepts including experience replay, target networks, and ε-greedy exploration strategies. The implementation demonstrates how deep learning can be effectively combined with Q-learning to solve continuous state space problems.\n",

        "## I. Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "### A. Motivation\n",
        "Traditional Q-learning algorithms maintain a tabular representation of state-action values, which becomes intractable for problems with large or continuous state spaces. The Deep Q-Network (DQN) addresses this limitation by using a deep neural network as a function approximator, enabling the agent to generalize across similar states.\n",
        "\n",
        "### B. Problem Statement\n",
        "The CartPole-v1 environment presents a classic control problem where an agent must balance a pole on a moving cart. The state space is continuous (4-dimensional), and the action space is discrete (2 actions: move left or right). The goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward by keeping the pole balanced as long as possible.\n",

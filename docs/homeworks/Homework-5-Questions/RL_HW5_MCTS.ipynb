        "[‚ÄúMastering Atari, Go, Chess and Shogi by Planning with a Learned Model‚Äù (Schrittwieser et al., 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08265).  \n",

        "\n",
        "## 1. Representation, Dynamics, and Prediction Networks\n",
        "\n",
        "MuZero (and algorithms inspired by it) relies on three core neural networks:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Representation Network (`RepresentationNet`)**  \n",
        "   - **Goal**: Convert raw observations (e.g., game frames, board states) into a latent (hidden) state.  \n",
        "   - **Why It Matters**: By encoding high-dimensional inputs (like pixel images) into a more compact form, downstream modules can operate efficiently on this latent space rather than the raw data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dynamics Network (`DynamicsNet`)**  \n",
        "   - **Goal**: Given the current hidden state and an action, predict the **next hidden state** and an **immediate reward estimate**.  \n",
        "   - **Why It Matters**: This is the ‚Äúmodel‚Äù portion of MuZero. It simulates how the hidden state changes when an action is taken, letting the algorithm plan forward without needing a hand-crafted or perfect simulator.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Prediction Network (`PredictionNet`)**  \n",
        "   - **Goal**: From a hidden state, predict:\n",
        "     1. **A policy distribution** (probabilities of selecting each possible action)\n",
        "     2. **A value estimate** (scalar measure of how good or bad the state is)  \n",
        "   - **Why It Matters**: This guides the search and learning, telling us which actions are promising (policy) and how favorable the current position might be (value).\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Naive Depth Search\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Monte Carlo Tree Search (`MCTS` Class)**  \n",
        "   - **Core Idea**: Repeatedly simulate many ‚Äúwhat if?‚Äù scenarios (rollouts) to gather statistics on which actions lead to higher value.  \n",
        "   - **Key Methods**:  \n",
        "     - `run(...)`: Manages the entire search process from the root hidden state.  \n",
        "     - `_expand_node(...)`: Expands a leaf node by calling the dynamics and prediction networks.  \n",
        "     - `_backpropagate(...)`: Propagates the newly obtained value estimates back up the search path.  \n",
        "     - `_calc_ucb(...)`: Calculates an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) score to balance exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (using known good actions).  \n",
        "     - `_compute_pi()`: Aggregates the visit counts of each child action at the root to form a final policy distribution.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Naive Depth Search (`naive_depth_search(...)`)**  \n",
        "   - **Core Idea**: Look ahead a fixed depth in a brute-force manner, expanding all action sequences up to that depth.  \n",
        "   - **Why It Matters**: Though less sophisticated than MCTS, it offers a simpler example of planning. It enumerates action branches, accumulates rewards and discounted values, and then picks the best sequence.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Buffer Replay\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Purpose**: Store entire trajectories (episodes) of experience, then allow sampling of smaller segments (sub-trajectories) for training.  \n",
        "- **How**:  \n",
        "  1. **`add_trajectories(...)`**: Inserts full episodes into the buffer.  \n",
        "  2. **`sample_sub_trajectory(...)`**: Retrieves a sub-trajectory of length `k` (for an n-step return) from the stored episodes.  \n",
        "  3. **`sample_batch(...)`**: Returns a batch of sub-trajectories for training the neural networks.  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Agent\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Role**: Central coordinator that uses the networks (Representation, Dynamics, Prediction) and search algorithms (MCTS or naive) to choose actions.  \n",
        "- **Key Functions**:\n",
        "  1. **`inference(...)`**: Given an observation, the agent converts it to a hidden state, then either:\n",
        "     - Runs MCTS to derive a policy (if `search_type=\"mcts\"`)\n",
        "     - Performs a naive depth search (if `search_type=\"naive\"`)\n",
        "     - Or uses the direct policy from the `PredictionNet` (if no search is enabled)  \n",
        "    The chosen action, along with the policy distribution and value estimate, is returned.\n",
        "  2. **`initial_step(...)`**: Processes the initial raw observation into a hidden state and then obtains policy/value estimates.  \n",
        "  3. **`rollout_step(...)`**: Given a hidden state plus actions, calls the `DynamicsNet` to get the next hidden state and reward, and the `PredictionNet` to predict policy/value at that new state.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. Overall Training Procedure\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Collect Trajectories**:  \n",
        "   - The agent interacts with the environment, using either MCTS or naive search to pick actions.  \n",
        "   - The environment returns observations/rewards that form trajectories (episodes).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Store in Replay**:  \n",
        "   - These full trajectories are added to the `BufferReplay`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Sample Mini-Batches**:  \n",
        "   - The training script samples sub-trajectories from the buffer (via `sample_sub_trajectory(...)` or `sample_batch(...)`).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Unroll the Model**:  \n",
        "   - For each sampled sub-trajectory, the code unrolls the networks (`RepresentationNet`, `DynamicsNet`, `PredictionNet`) for multiple steps (up to `k`) to compare the model‚Äôs predictions to the actual transitions.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Compute Loss & Update**:  \n",
        "   - The total loss typically includes terms for:\n",
        "     - **Value error** (predicted vs. actual return)\n",
        "     - **Policy error** (predicted policy vs. search-derived/improved policy)\n",
        "     - **Reward error** (predicted vs. actual immediate reward)  \n",
        "   - Backpropagation updates the parameters of all three networks end-to-end.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Repeat**:  \n",
        "   - Continue this cycle of data collection and network updates until convergence."

        "1. **Storing Trajectories**:  \n",
        "   - `add_trajectories(new_trajectories)`: Appends new trajectories to the buffer. If the capacity is exceeded, it overwrites old trajectories in a circular manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Sampling Sub-Trajectories**:  \n",
        "   - `sample_sub_trajectory(k, n, discount)`: Randomly selects a single trajectory from the buffer, chooses a random start index within that trajectory, and extracts a sub-trajectory of length `k` for training. It also computes an `n`-step return for each step in the sub-trajectory, taking into account the discount factor.  \n",
        "   - `sample_batch(batch_size, k, n, discount)`: Repeats the above sub-trajectory sampling multiple times to form a training batch.\n",

        "  - Type/Shape: Each entry is usually a tensor of shape `(num_actions,)`, giving the probability distribution over actions.  \n",
        "- **\"v\"**: (If included in your design) a list of value estimates for each step in the sub-trajectory.  \n",

        "  - Type/Shape: Each entry typically an integer in the range `[0, num_actions-1]`.  \n",

        "In this section, we have several classes and functions that support Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a naive depth-based search approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **`AdaptiveNormalizer`**  \n",
        "   - Tracks the running minimum and maximum values of inputs (e.g., Q-values).  \n",
        "   - Allows for on-the-fly normalization of these values, which can stabilize the search process.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`TreeNode`**  \n",
        "   - Represents a node in the MCTS search tree.  \n",
        "   - Stores statistics such as visit counts, the sum of value estimates, child edges, and prior probabilities.  \n",
        "   - The node can also store a hidden state representation and an estimated reward for transitioning from a parent node.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **`MCTS` Class**  \n",
        "   - Controls the MCTS search process.  \n",
        "   - Contains key methods like `run`, `_expand_node`, `_backpropagate`, `_calc_ucb`, and `_compute_pi` for performing MCTS simulations, updating node statistics, and calculating action visit distributions.  \n",
        "   - Uses a dynamics model and prediction model to simulate the environment forward and estimate policies/values.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **`naive_depth_search` Function**  \n",
        "   - Demonstrates a simpler (but inefficient) depth-based search.  \n",
        "   - Expands all actions up to a certain depth, computes rewards and leaf values, then picks the action sequence with the highest total return.\n",

        "- **`TreeNode`**:  \n",
        "  - Stores `edges` mapping each possible action to another `TreeNode`.  \n",

        "     - Returns the **visit counts** over actions (used to derive a policy) and the **average value** of the root node.  \n",
        "  2. **`_expand_node(parent_node, new_node, chosen_action)`**:  \n",
        "     - Expands the leaf node by calling the environment (or model) with a chosen action, obtaining the next hidden state, policy, value, and reward.  \n",
        "     - Creates children edges for all possible actions from the new state.  \n",
        "     - Returns the new value estimate for further backpropagation.  \n",
        "  3. **`_backpropagate(leaf_value)`**:  \n",
        "     - Starts at the leaf node and moves backward through the search path, updating each node‚Äôs visit count and total value sum with the discounted reward.  \n",
        "  4. **`_calc_ucb(parent, child)`**:  \n",
        "     - Calculates the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) score for a given child node.  \n",
        "     - Uses the node‚Äôs prior probability, visit counts, and normalized value estimates to balance exploration and exploitation.  \n",
        "     - Returns a scalar score that can be used to pick the best child action.  \n",
        "  5. **`_compute_pi()`**:  \n",
        "     - Aggregates the visit counts for each action at the root node, which can be used as an approximate policy distribution.\n",

        "# `Agent` Class\n",
        "\n",
        "The `Agent` class is a neural network module that coordinates between:\n",
        "- A **representation network** (`rep_net`) to encode raw observations into a hidden state.\n",
        "- A **dynamics network** (`dyn_net`) to predict the next hidden state and reward given a current hidden state and action.\n",
        "- A **prediction network** (`pred_net`) to output a policy distribution and value estimate from a hidden state.\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent can use different search strategies to pick actions:\n",
        "1. **MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search)**  \n",
        "   - When `search_type=\"mcts\"`, the agent constructs an MCTS object to run simulations and pick an action from the resulting search tree.\n",
        "2. **Naive Depth Search**  \n",
        "   - When `search_type=\"naive\"`, the agent expands possible actions up to a specified `search_depth`, and chooses the best outcome.\n",
        "3. **Direct Prediction**  \n",
        "   - Otherwise, the agent relies purely on the `pred_net`‚Äôs policy and value to pick actions without search.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Methods:\n",
        "- **`forward(obs)`**: Overrides the PyTorch module‚Äôs forward method (not used directly in the search logic here).\n",
        "- **`inference(obs_tensor)`**: Determines the action to take given an input observation. This may involve MCTS or naive search, or direct prediction, depending on the agent‚Äôs settings.\n",
        "- **`initial_step(obs)`**: Produces the hidden state representation and an initial policy/value from a raw observation. Useful for MCTS when creating the root node.\n",
        "- **`rollout_step(hidden_s, chosen_actions)`**: Given hidden states and chosen actions, predicts the next hidden states, immediate rewards, and the policy/value at those next states.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Desired Outputs\n",
        "- **`inference(obs_tensor)`**:\n",
        "  - **action_int**: An integer action index chosen by the search or direct policy sampling.\n",
        "  - **policy_distribution**: A NumPy array (or torch tensor) of shape `(num_actions,)`, representing the probability distribution over actions.\n",
        "  - **estimated_value**: A scalar estimate (float or tensor) of the state‚Äôs value.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`initial_step(obs)`**:\n",
        "  - **s**: The hidden state tensor generated by `rep_net(obs)`.\n",
        "  - **pol**: The policy distribution (shape: `(1, num_actions)`) predicted by the `pred_net`.\n",
        "  - **v**: The value estimate (shape: `(1,)` or `(1,1)`) from the `pred_net`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`rollout_step(hidden_s, chosen_actions)`**:\n",
        "  - **next_hidden**: The predicted next hidden state(s).\n",
        "  - **p**: The predicted policy distribution(s).\n",
        "  - **v**: The predicted value(s).\n",
        "  - **predicted_reward**: The immediate reward estimate(s) from the dynamics network.\n"

## Key Takeaways

### Main Insights

1. **Distributional Shift is Fundamental**
   - Core challenge: policy queries out-of-distribution actions
   - Errors compound through Bellman updates
   - Requires careful regularization

2. **Multiple Successful Approaches**
   - **Conservative methods** (CQL, IQL): Lower-bound Q-values
   - **Behavior regularization** (BCQ): Constrain to dataset actions
   - **Model-based** (MOPO): Uncertainty-aware planning

3. **Practical Performance**
   - State-of-the-art achieves 60-80% of expert performance
   - 3-4x sample efficiency improvement over online RL
   - Robust across different dataset qualities

4. **Trade-offs Matter**
   - CQL: Most stable, moderate performance
   - IQL: Best average performance, faster training
   - BCQ: Safety-constrained, limited improvement
   - MOPO: Sample-efficient, computationally expensive

### Algorithm Selection Guide

```python
if dataset_size < 10000:
    use_algorithm = "MOPO"  # Model-based for small data
elif stability_critical:
    use_algorithm = "CQL"   # Most stable
elif want_best_performance:
    use_algorithm = "IQL"   # Highest scores
elif must_stay_safe:
    use_algorithm = "BCQ"   # Behavior-constrained
else:
    use_algorithm = "CQL"   # Good default
```

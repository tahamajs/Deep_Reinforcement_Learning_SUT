        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "RND (Random Network Distillation) was first proposed in [Exploration by Random Network Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12894), which introduces an exploration bonus for deep reinforcement learning methods that is easy to implement and adds minimal overhead to the computation performed. The exploration bonus is the error of a neural network predicting features of the observations given by a fixed randomly initialized neural network. RND claims that it is the first method that achieves better than average human performance on Montezuma’s Revenge without using demonstrations or having access to the underlying state of the game.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Quick Facts\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The insight behind exploration approaches is that we first establish a method to measure the **novelty of states**, namely, how well we know this state, or the number of times we have visited a state similar to it. Then we assign an exploration reward in proportional to the novelty measure of the state. If the visited state is more novel, or say the state is explored very few times, the agent will get a bigger intrinsic reward. On the contrary, if the agent is more familiar with this state, or say, the state has been explored many times, the agent will get a smaller intrinsic reward on this state.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. RND is a **prediction-error-based** exploration approach that can be applied in non-tabular cases. The main idea of prediction-error-based approaches is that defining the intrinsic reward as the prediction error for a problem related to the agent’s transitions, such as learning forward dynamics model, learning inverse dynamics model, or even a randomly generated problem, which is the case in RND algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. RND involves **two neural networks**: a fixed and randomly initialized target network which sets the prediction problem, and a predictor network trained on data collected by the agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. In RND paper, the underlying base RL algorithm is off-policy PPO. Generally, RND intrinsic reward generation model can be combined with many different RL algorithms such as DDPG, TD3, **SAC** conveniently.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Amount of training data**  \n",
        "   Prediction error is high where few similar examples were seen by the predictor.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Stochasticity**  \n",
        "   Prediction error is high because the target function is stochastic. Stochastic transitions are a source of such error for forward dynamics prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Model misspecification**  \n",
        "   Prediction error is high because information necessary for the prediction is missing, or the model class of predictors is too limited to fit the complexity of the target function.\n",

        "  - General case: Can use max game length as weight factor\n",
        "  - Critical for balancing exploration vs exploitation\n",

        "  1. Subtract running mean\n",
        "  2. Divide by running standard deviation\n",
        "  3. Clip values to [-5, 5] range\n",

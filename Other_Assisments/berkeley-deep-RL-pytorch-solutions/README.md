# UC Berkeley Deep RL Pytorch Solutions

Pytorch solutions for [UC Berkeley's CS285 Deep RL course](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/). If you wish to complete the assignments yourself, a [pytorch version](https://github.com/mdeib/berkeley-deep-RL-pytorch-starter) of the [official starter code](https://github.com/berkeleydeeprlcourse/homework_fall2019) has also been made.

While these solutions have produced reasonable results be aware that there may still be small bugs in the code and/or the solutions.

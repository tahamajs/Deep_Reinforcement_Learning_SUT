# Assignment 2 — Question 1

Author: Mohammad taha majlesi - 810101504

Summary
-------
Implement a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) from scratch using PyTorch tensors and train it on Fashion-MNIST. The notebook implements forward/backward passes (for demonstration) and trains the model while plotting loss and accuracy.

Files
-----
- `q1.ipynb` — notebook with implementation, training loop, evaluation and plots.
- `Figures/q1_*` — saved images (random samples, loss/accuracy plots, confusion matrix).

How to run
----------
1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies and open `q1.ipynb` in Jupyter.

Notes
-----
- Consider switching to `torch.nn` + built-in optimizers to speed up experiments.
